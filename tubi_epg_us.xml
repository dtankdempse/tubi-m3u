With each new robbery, the bandits perfected their craft, leaving behind no evidence and escaping with hundreds and thousands of dollars.  As the robbers became increasingly violent, pressure mounted to end their reign.  With few leads, the FBI forced their own luck.  The effort put them face to face with an armed and desperate fugitive.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20241229190000 +0000" stop="20241229200000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In the early 1980's, a pair of serial bank robbers gained a reputation among law enforcement officials as formidable bandits.  Using the same modus operandi, the two men took hostages and emptied bank vaults across the Midwest.  After the criminals escaped from police custody, FBI agents familiar with the bandits believed that they would attempt a grand-scale heist.  By conducting surveillance on known associates of the criminals, authorities tried to anticipate the next target.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20241229200000 +0000" stop="20241229210000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In 1991, the Safe Streets Task Force, a joint FBI / Washington D.C.

Left behind was a mysterious ransom note listing twelve names and no specific instructions.  The note, and a few drops of blood were the only clues to her fate. FBI and local police struggled to find answers in the cryptic message so they could find the kidnapper and retrieve the victim before her time ran out. Solving the crime required the keen insight of a criminal profiler and the perseverance of a family, local authorities, and the FBI.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20241229220000 +0000" stop="20241229230000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In June of 2000, two gunmen rob a Seattle, WA bank, and flee on foot as officers chase them.

They've both had successful careers in the brewery business so when they bought Moore Place they believed they could make it an instant success.  What they hadn't realized was just how difficult it would be to fill the 90-seater oak-paneled restaurant and how hard it would be to find a chef who could cook decent food.

Has Ramsay's fast-track guide to restaurant success helped these brewery whiz-kids transform their failing ex-Berni Inn into a profitable business? And is the building still painted that disgusting shade of purple?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241228061900 +0000" stop="20241228072400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The episode that has gone down in TV history. Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in "fine dining", he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241228072400 +0000" stop="20241228082000 +0000"><title>Tattoo
