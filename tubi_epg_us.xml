Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241102190000 +0000" stop="20241102193000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend: Saturday</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241102193000 +0000" stop="20241102200000 +0000"><title>Protecting Your Vote</title><desc>ABC News Live Special Programming.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241102200000 +0000" stop="20241102203000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend: Saturday</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241102203000 +0000" stop="20241102210000 +0000"><title>Protecting Your Vote</title><desc>ABC News Live Special Programming.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241102210000 +0000" stop="20241102213000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend: Saturday</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241102213000 +0000" stop="20241102220000 +0000"><title>January 6th: The Fight to Rewrite History</title><desc>ABC News Live Special Programming.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241102220000 +0000" stop="20241103000000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><channel id="556174"><display-name>NBC News NOW</display-name><icon src="https://canvas.tubitv.com/opts/CGM972sEdvuVcQ==/a9097c5c-9374-49bd-b791-639fe3c02017/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjJAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="556174" start="20241101010000 +0000" stop="20241101020000 +0000"><title>Top Story With Tom Llamas</title><desc>Reporting of breaking news and developing stories in real time.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20241101020000 +0000" stop="20241101030000 +0000"><title>NBC Nightly News With Lester Holt</title><desc>The latest news, going beyond the headlines to see how lives are affected by the world around them.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20241101030000 +0000" stop="20241101040000 +0000"><title>Stay Tuned NOW With Gadi Schwartz</title><desc>A fresh look at the day's news, from the latest breaking news to what's on the horizon.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20241101040000 +0000" stop="20241101050000 +0000"><title>Top Story With Tom Llamas</title><desc>Reporting of breaking news and developing stories in real time.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20241101050000 +0000" stop="20241101060000 +0000"><title>NBC Nightly News With Lester Holt</title><desc>The latest news, going beyond the headlines to see how lives are affected by the world around them.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20241101060000 +0000" stop="20241101070000 +0000"><title>Dateline NBC</title><desc>A murder outside Pleasantville, Iowa, divides a family and forces one man to take the investigation into his own hands.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20241101070000 +0000" stop="20241101080000 +0000"><title>Dateline NBC</title><desc>Investigators are suspicious when a wealthy former radio DJ mysteriously disappears from his yacht in the Pacific Ocean.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20241101080000 +0000" stop="20241101090000 +0000"><title>Dateline NBC</title><desc>The battle between a wife and a mistress for one man's heart leads to a deadly car chase.</desc></programme><programme channel="556174" start="20241101090000 +0000" stop="20241101093000 +0000"><title>Early Today</title><desc>This early-morning news shows, that precedes local newscasts in many markets, covers overnight events, breaking domestic and international news as well as a preview of the day's anticipated events.

Huckberry and GORUCK go way back, we’ve shared plenty of good times, GORUCK Challenges, and (more than) a few beers along the way. Their military-grade lineup is designed to be taken to hell and back in the field.

Tired of fixing up other people's houses, Ben decided to spend the last few years crafting his own house from the ground up, while getting help from his friends, Dad, and Sophie along the way. This one-of-a-kind home now serves as a gathering place for creatives and surfers alike, nestled between the forest and Oregon coast.On Huckberry Homes, we’ll be tapping into the most inspiring members of the Huckberry community to offer an inside peek into how they’ve crafted the place they call home. We will showcase everything from cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that inspire creativity and high-performing lives.We would like to take a moment to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples who have stewarded the land on which this video was created. This area was the home to the Nestucca peoples and other coastal tribes until the mid-1800s when the population was decimated by diseases from settlers. Those who remained were coerced into a coastal reservation by the US government. Let us remember the histories and cultures that have shaped this land."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241101073406 +0000" stop="20241101074512 +0000"><title>Huckberry Homes</title><desc>"In this special edition episode of Huckberry Homes, we travel to New York to get a rare look inside The Explorers Club headquarters. For the last 120 years, The Explorers Club has been the exclusive epicenter where legendary explorers come together to share some of the most incredible adventure stories ever told. From Roald Amundsen’s 1911 voyage to the South Pole to Sir Edmund Hillary’s ascent to the summit of Mount Everest to astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s history-changing 1969 expedition to the moon, the halls of this institution have echoed with tales of daring discovery and unparalleled human achievement. That’s why we’re beyond stoked to kick off our Huckberry x The Explorers Club partnership—featuring the Land, Sea, and Space Collection from an exclusive Whiskey Peaks collab and a badass grand prize.

We will showcase everything from cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that inspire creativity and high-performing lives.For our first entry, we turned to Austin, Texas’ own Scott Ballew.
