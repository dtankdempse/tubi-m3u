Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241103090000 +0000" stop="20241103110000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241103110000 +0000" stop="20241103130000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241103130000 +0000" stop="20241103133000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241103133000 +0000" stop="20241103140000 +0000"><title>GMA Life</title><desc>A weekly roundup of the best lifestyle content from "Good Morning America"; includes exclusive celebrity content, savings from "Deals &amp; Steals," and interviews with authors behind some of the most anticipated books.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241103140000 +0000" stop="20241103143000 +0000"><title>Good Morning America - Top Stories</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241103143000 +0000" stop="20241103150000 +0000"><title>GMA Life</title><desc>A weekly roundup of the best lifestyle content from "Good Morning America"; includes exclusive celebrity content, savings from "Deals &amp; Steals," and interviews with authors behind some of the most anticipated books.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241103150000 +0000" stop="20241103153000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekends</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241103153000 +0000" stop="20241103160000 +0000"><title>Protecting Your Vote</title><desc>ABC News Live Special Programming.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241103160000 +0000" stop="20241103170000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekends</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241103170000 +0000" stop="20241103180000 +0000"><title>This Week With George Stephanopoulos</title><desc>Former Clinton White House staffer and current co-anchor of ABC's weekday morning news show "Good Morning America," George Stephanopoulos and co-anchors Martha Raddatz and Jonathan Karl offer a look at current events with a focus on the politics of the day.

After setting up in the hardwoods on the edge of a field, a few longbeards pitch down and come straight to the call. It results in a quick hunt on a beautiful morning.

We will showcase everything from cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that inspire creativity and high-performing lives.We would like to take a moment to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples who have stewarded the land on which this video was created. This area was the home to the Nestucca peoples and other coastal tribes until the mid-1800s when the population was decimated by diseases from settlers. Those who remained were coerced into a coastal reservation by the US government.

This area was the home to the Nestucca peoples and other coastal tribes until the mid-1800s when the population was decimated by diseases from settlers. Those who remained were coerced into a coastal reservation by the US government.

The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241103024100 +0000" stop="20241103034300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241103034300 +0000" stop="20241103044500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241103044500 +0000" stop="20241103053900 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay checks in to The River Rock Inn in Milford Pennsylvania, where owner Ken Pisciotta is over his head and drowning in debt.
