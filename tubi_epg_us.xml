Hog Deer have a typical appearance for species of the genus Axis. However, they differ from axis deer by their sturdy build and short-faced appearance. On day one of their hunt, Mark lays eyes on his first Hog Deer. During their pursuit, a really good Blackbuck appears over the horizon. They quickly make a move and Mark puts down an awesome Blackbuck. The day is still young and the team decides to hit one more spot for a Hog Deer.

Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes.

Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead. Several people soon come forward with multiple wills, which confuse the matter, but when two more people, close friends of Rex, are also murdered, the investigation raises question on the motive, leading Barnaby to wonder if it was down to finances, passion, or something from Rex's past.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241108155800 +0000" stop="20241108174500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Following the death of Alan King while on a business trip to China, the family company, King's Crystal, is in financial trouble.

During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large.

There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241108211900 +0000" stop="20241108230600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village.

With little evidence and no suspects, agents were willing to try anything to find the violent perpetrators.  On April 11, 1986, agents conducting routine surveillance spotted the vehicle used in the bank robberies.  They attempted to arrest the two suspects in the car.  What followed was the bloodiest firefight in FBI history.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20241108110000 +0000" stop="20241108120000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>Beginning in summer of 1990, the bodies of several women began turning up in and around the city of Vienna, Austria. From an extensive investigation by the Viennese police, it was determined that these murders were the work of one sadistic predator.  Europe was dealing with a serial killer.

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241108163300 +0000" stop="20241108173500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241108173500 +0000" stop="20241108183800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue is The Runaway Girl, a tapas bar-cum-nightclub in Sheffield city centre on the brink of collapse. The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241108183800 +0000" stop="20241108194000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point. The restaurant is on its last legs - they've run out of customers, money and hope. Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241108194000 +0000" stop="20241108204100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>Jay banishes Ant's backside buddy, and Alice helps Chelsea get over the shock of her life.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241108204100 +0000" stop="20241108214300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241108214300 +0000" stop="20241108224500 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241108224500 +0000" stop="20241108233900 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay checks in to the luxury Lakeview Hotel in Lake Chelan, Washington.

La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241109081200 +0000" stop="20241109091600 +0000"><title>The Perfect Vagina</title><desc>Lisa Rogers tries to find out why more and more women are considering vaginal surgery for either aesthetic or cultural reasons.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241109091600 +0000" stop="20241109101600 +0000"><title>Love Me, Love My Doll</title><desc>Men who have been unable to form relationships with real women choose custom-made, life-sized dolls to serve as their romantic partners.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241109101600 +0000" stop="20241109111500 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers on Holiday</title><desc>The Fixers holiday hijinks continue, and this week Glen rids Mandy of her rabbits, Jay pulls off the perfect portrait and Alice gets her teeth into Helen’s cupcake.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241109111500 +0000" stop="20241109121500 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers on Holiday</title><desc>Sketch takes on Bex whose stinker of a tat has left her feeling unloved, Alice helps Nikki with a tat that has mistakenly mugged off her husband.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241109121500 +0000" stop="20241109130700 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits West Dover in Vermont, to try to save a dog-friendly hotel that’s desperately in need of help.

Ex Royal Marine pilot Harry swoops on a street in Castleford to drop his medics next to an unconscious cyclist feared to have a brain injury. Paramedics Sammy and Ady find themselves dealing with a difficult patient who insists he wants to climb back on his badly damaged motorbike thanks to bizarre effects of a head injury sustained in the accident. Flying doctor Jez is confronted by a baffling whodunnit after a man is accidentally shot at a firing range. A jockey thrown by his galloping horse amazes the team with his toughness as he undergoes treatment on a broken bone without even flinching. Meanwhile, a crash outside one of Yorkshire’s most famous stately homes leaves a man with a chronic medical condition trapped in his upturned car. On the moors, paramedics Pete and Lee rescue an off road biker injured when his motorcycle toppled off a rock.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241109174300 +0000"
