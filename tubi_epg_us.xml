Nestled inside a small nook of Playa Herradura, Costa Rica’s Los Sueños Resort and Marina serves as a luxury embarkation point for some of the world’s most heralded bluewater fishing.

A massive FBI investigation led to the recovery of the bodies of the slain men and physical evidence was recovered and analyzed. The FBI labs confirmed that all but one of the bullets used to kill the men came from the same gun.

Residents screamed for the police to stop this serial killer.  With no suspects, local investigators turned to the FBI.

Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large. The detectives soon have to delve into a world of rock music, drug use and greed, to find the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241209090000 +0000" stop="20241209110000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The suspicious death of popular young GP Dr Alan Delaney brings Barnaby and Jones to Midsomer Market to investigate.

There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241209110000 +0000" stop="20241209120000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>Angie's mother's new beau hires Everett and Shade, when his clinic's database is hacked.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241209120000 +0000" stop="20241209130000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>Shade and Angie investigate a vandalized shop.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241209130000 +0000" stop="20241209140000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>Angie's college roommate calls for help when a bottle of wine is stolen.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241209140000 +0000" stop="20241209150000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>Shade ends up in the middle of a hostage situation in a high-rise office, while Maz attempts to control the situation on the ground.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241209150000 +0000" stop="20241209160000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>When Becca calls on Shade and Angie to investigate a series of potentially supernatural accidents that threaten to derail her new TV special, the PI's find themselves tap dancing their way through the cut throat world of reality television.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241209160000 +0000" stop="20241209170000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>Shade and Angie are brought in to investigate the death of Eddie Conroy's dear friend, as he's convinced the man was murdered.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241209170000 +0000" stop="20241209180000 +0000"><title>Hudson &amp;
