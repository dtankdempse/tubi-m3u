He has also seen the dramatic rise in shark populations and has decided to do something about it.Congressman Rob Whittman came on the show to explain the new legislation he is co-sponsoring to try to help curb the Shark Depredation that is affecting fisherman all up and down our coasts.Follow the Congressman on YouTube: @RobWittmanFollow the Congressman on Instagram: @reprobwittmanLearn more about the legislation: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://wittman.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID%3D5074&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1691708517016000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0HAqYBdOO717jCLeeHBlgRVideo Credits: https://www.instagram.com/kaitmariedesigns/ and Dillon Mayhttps://www.instagram.com/robchapmanfishing/https://www.instagram.com/fuck.the.taxman/https://www.instagram.com/ryanherbach/https://www.instagram.com/salty_henry/https://www.instagram.com/smelsdaddy34/https://www.instagram.com/finplannersportfishing/https://www.instagram.com/delphfishing/</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241121045128 +0000" stop="20241121050024 +0000"><title>TRP</title><desc>This week's episode of How To Tuesday we are tying and testing the Bimini Twist.

La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241120185200 +0000" stop="20241120195500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire. The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~¬£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241120195500 +0000" stop="20241120205700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~¬£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241120205700 +0000" stop="20241120215500 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage are tasked with refloating a pre-World War II boat, but on the way to the site, team leader Luke receives an emergency SOS about another mission.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241120215500 +0000" stop="20241120225300 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage are tasked with refloating a pre-World War II boat, but on the way to the site, team leader Luke receives an emergency SOS about another mission.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241120225300 +0000" stop="20241120234700 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits the Cambridge Hotel, New York, where ex-military man John Imhof and his wife, Tina, own and run the allegedly haunted Cambridge Hotel.

It is the prime example of HOW NOT TO RUN A RESTAURANT. Owner DAVE is the flakey self-appointed head chef, who hasn't been in a kitchen for 30 years and can't cook. His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce". Gordon faces a hellish week, Clubway 41 is breaking every rule in book, can he bring Dave, Dawn and their food back to earth?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241121023700 +0000" stop="20241121034100 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Tonight's program sees Gordon Ramsay in Oscars in Nantwich.

Owner MAURA runs the front of house and her son LENIN is the Head chef, but it's not "happy families". With her life savings on the line Maura is in big trouble. She constantly bickers with her son whilst the customers are forced to wait hours for their fluorescent crab stick paellas, and stodgy carbonaras from Oscars "bit of everything" menu.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241121034100 +0000" stop="20241121044400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's program Gordon Ramsay travels to the seaside to help ailing hotel and restaurant, The Sandgate.

New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241121054700 +0000" stop="20241121064800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241121064800 +0000" stop="20241121074700 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Sketch tucks away Andy's massive mishap; Alice cleans up Sam's idiotic inking; Uzzi and Pash team up to tackle Joe's gigantic and sleazy slogan; Pash creates a new design for car crash survivor Debbie.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241121074700 +0000" stop="20241121080000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Sketch invalidates Kieran's raunchy request; Alice spices up superfan Hugo's life; Pash covers Shelly's preposterous poem; Uzzi reins in Craig's horrible horse; Harry's vegan tattoo gets revamped.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241121080000 +0000" stop="20241121090100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Sketch invalidates Kieran's raunchy request; Alice spices up superfan Hugo's life; Pash covers Shelly's preposterous poem; Uzzi reins in Craig's horrible horse; Harry's vegan tattoo gets revamped.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241121090100 +0000" stop="20241121101300 +0000"><title>Addicted to Boob Jobs</title><desc>Journalist Louise Roe investigates why women in the United Kingdom have plastic surgery on their breasts not just once, but multiple times.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241121101300 +0000" stop="20241121111700 +0000"><title>The Kinky Sex Survey</title><desc>Ordinary people from across the U.K. reveal their favorite fetishes, kinks and unusual sexual practices; experts explain where unusual sexual desires come from and why there's no such thing as normal.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241121111700 +0000" stop="20241121114900 +0000"><title>Program information currently unavailable.</title></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241121114900 +0000" stop="20241121121900 +0000"><title>Chopper Squad</title><desc>The Rescue 1 team is en route to the scene of a horrific accident; a pedestrian has been hit by a truck and is in a critical condition.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241121121900 +0000" stop="20241121125000 +0000"><title>Chopper Squad</title><desc>What's it like to be in Auckland, New Zealand‚Äôs rapid response helicopter paramedic team?
