As a result, Yami Marik becomes angered, and attacks Odion with the Millennium Rod, which weakens Odion even more. Odion doesn't give up, despite Ishizu's protests. As Marik continues his onslaught (which begins to injure Odion), Odion tells Marik's good side that together, they had conquered his evil half before, and that they could do it again. Then, he tells the good Marik that since Yami Marik was created by the good Marik's hatred, he has the power to destroy him. As Yami Marik raises the Rod to deliver the final blow, the good Marik disappears from the field, and begins fighting against Yami Marik, who struggles for control over Marik's body, and refuses to be defeated. However, Marik's good half stalls Yami Marik long enough for Yugi to activate his spell card. Yugi's Ragnarok spell succeeds in destroying (and removing to the graveyard) Ra, allowing the good Marik to regain control of his body. However, a sliver of Yami Marik reappears on the field, although this time, he is the victim. Yami Marik tries to convince the good Marik to help him seize the Millennium Items and rule the world together, but fails as Marik has decided to stop being evil and make up for his actions. Marik surrenders the duel to Yugi, which sends Yami Marik to the Shadow Realm, ending the Battle City finals. Bakura and Mai are returned from the shadow realm and Marik is reunited with his siblings, who forgive him. Yugi receives the three Egyptian God Cards. Kaiba then activates the Duel Tower's self-destruct sequence, giving everybody one hour to get off the island before it explodes.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20241203020000 +0000" stop="20241203023000 +0000"><title>Yu-Gi-Oh!</title><desc>Yugi and the gang escape from the island in time, but they are forced to leave Kaiba and Mokuba behind.

The company is thinking about increasing Tom's exposure by producing a new television show around him. Liz Madison is the advice columnist for the little read community newspaper, the Marin County Voice, which is a throwback to gentler times. Besides their journalistic occupations, one other similar aspect between Tom and Liz is that they are both currently single, with their friends and family doing whatever they can to find that special someone for their personal life. On November 2, the staff at the Voice learn that the Sun ownership has bought their newspaper, with the probable goal of folding it into the operations of the Sun. If this move does happen, the staff at the Voice will lose their jobs.

Loic is on a mission, to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of haggis, tatties and deep-fried Mars bars. But though he's hungry for success, he's French, he's arrogant and the food's pretentious.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241203231200 +0000" stop="20241204001400 +0000"><title>Hoarders SOS (Season 1)</title><desc>The Hoarder SOS team help two households whose clutter is so catastrophic it is taking over their homes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241204001400 +0000" stop="20241204011500 +0000"><title>Hoarders SOS (Season 1)</title><desc>The Hoarder SOS team help a man who can’t say no to his family’s unwanted stuff and is desperate to reclaim his home.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241204011500 +0000" stop="20241204021400 +0000"><title>Hoarders SOS (Season 1)</title><desc>Declutter expert Joanna Riley can't even get into the garage, where clutter includes 16 vacuum cleaners.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241204021400 +0000" stop="20241204030800 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>It’s Gordon’s greatest challenge to date, as he continues to uncover problem after problem at Vermont’s Juniper Hill Inn.
