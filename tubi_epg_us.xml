Shortly before leaving their hotel they mention they haven't been able to find what they're looking for; "something old and derelict that they can do up." Anne Merrick tells them about Winyard, a tumbledown cottage in the woods, might be for sale. At the estate agents they are told the house is not yet available for viewing. Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter. The next morning they are found strangled in their own car. DCI Barnaby starts the investigation with the help of PC Ben Jones and they come across the world of estate agents, identical twins, ghosts, piano wire, and more before another body turns up.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241229192700 +0000" stop="20241229212100 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Villagers of Midsomer Barton are all set to celebrate Oak Apple Week, especially as the carnival queen event is set to return after an eight year absence.
