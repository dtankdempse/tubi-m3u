contestants on Wipeout Australia are bought undone by a seemingly simple obstacle on the Qualifier, the Slippery Stairs. It’s all in the name really, an innocent set of stairs, covered in Wipeout Crash cream. Its up the way and down the way for all and sundry. The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris. It’s a colourful week with leotards, laughs and lots of ladies.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241122105317 +0000" stop="20241122114918 +0000"><title>Wipeout Canada</title><desc>Beam and Jets, Field Goal Swing, The Toothbrush Bristles, Tippy Tables and Dock Maze are among some of the over-the-top obstacles in this week’s episode.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241122114918 +0000" stop="20241122124344 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>Showdowns don’t come more epic than this. Pro Wrestler Mikey takes on Wipeout Australias very own Tom Cruise. Its neck and neck through the qualifier which this week includes a real Mission Impossible, Dirty Balls. The trash talk is as fierce as the competition and continues to the Wipeout Zone with the winner taking not only the $20,000 but also the glory. Australia is also introduced to a new kind of “violent love”, the Fight Hug.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241122124344 +0000" stop="20241122133924 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>Wipeout Australia debunks the myth that only young, fit and funky people should go on game shows. This week we are forced to take notice of Demolition Dave, a 49 yr old South Australia man who thanks to some home training smashes the qualifier. For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241122133924 +0000" stop="20241122145250 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>Richard Hammond, Amanda Byram, and the Big Red Balls are back!</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241122145250 +0000" stop="20241122160553 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In the first episode of season 3, Richard Hammond introduces a brand new challenge called Crash Mountain.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241122160553 +0000" stop="20241122170153 +0000"><title>Wipeout Canada</title><desc>Slippery Stairs, Block Swing, The Crusher, Log Roll, and Barrel Crossing are some of the over-the-top obstacles in this week’s episode.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241122170153 +0000" stop="20241122181708 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>This is the second 'Celebrity Special' of the season.

This one-of-a-kind home now serves as a gathering place for creatives and surfers alike, nestled between the forest and Oregon coast.On Huckberry Homes, we’ll be tapping into the most inspiring members of the Huckberry community to offer an inside peek into how they’ve crafted the place they call home. We will showcase everything from cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that inspire creativity and high-performing lives.We would like to take a moment to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples who have stewarded the land on which this video was created. This area was the home to the Nestucca peoples and other coastal tribes until the mid-1800s when the population was decimated by diseases from settlers. Those who remained were coerced into a coastal reservation by the US government. Let us remember the histories and cultures that have shaped this land."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241123031756 +0000" stop="20241123033026 +0000"><title>Gear Lab</title><desc>Embracing passion.
