On this adventure, Mark is toting his Gunwerks BlastR handgun as he hunts the swamps with his sights set on a big mature gator. Alligators are typically judged in the field by looking at the distance from their eyes to the tip of their nose. The rule of thumb is that they grow a foot in length every year until they are eight years old, then grown an inch per year after that. At 13 feet 3 inches, this old gator is one for the books.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241211152640 +0000" stop="20241211154407 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Mark Peterson is still in Florida and looking for gator number two.

On this adventure, Mark is toting his Gunwerks BlastR handgun as he hunts the swamps with his sights set on a big mature gator. Alligators are typically judged in the field by looking at the distance from their eyes to the tip of their nose. The rule of thumb is that they grow a foot in length every year until they are eight years old, then grown an inch per year after that. At 13 feet 3 inches, this old gator is one for the books.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241211152640 +0000" stop="20241211154407 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Mark Peterson is still in Florida and looking for gator number two.

When the post mortem confirms her death was no accident, the pair discover that nothing is what it seems to be within the little village as they try to find out what exactly she saw.

When Agnes's cousin, Esslyn Carmichael, inadvertently cuts his own throat during the final act, it's quickly discovered that the tape on the prop blade he had used was removed without anyone knowing.

Big soul momma, owner Charita Jones, produces a menu of irresistibly unique classics from the Deep South. The food's hard to fault but the punters are nowhere to be seen, Head Chef Brian and a rag-tag collection of part-timers are taking the mickey - and despite working a seven-day week Charita's got an empty restaurant and a ~£65,000 debt.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241210220900 +0000" stop="20241210231200 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's fourth programme is La Riviera, a fine dining restaurant in Inverness. Owned by multi-millionaire Barry Larson and costing ~£8000 a week to run, the place boasts top French chef Loic Lefebvre and an impeccably-trained kitchen staff with Michelin star-studded backgrounds. Loic is on a mission, to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of haggis, tatties and deep-fried Mars bars. But though he's hungry for success, he's French, he's arrogant and the food's pretentious.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241210231200 +0000" stop="20241211001400 +0000"><title>Hoarders SOS (Season 1)</title><desc>The Hoarder SOS team help two households whose clutter is so catastrophic it is taking over their homes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241211001400 +0000" stop="20241211011500 +0000"><title>Hoarders SOS (Season 1)</title><desc>The Hoarder SOS team help a man who can’t say no to his family’s unwanted stuff and is desperate to reclaim his home.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241211011500 +0000" stop="20241211021400 +0000"><title>Hoarders SOS (Season 1)</title><desc>Declutter expert Joanna Riley can't even get into the garage, where clutter includes 16 vacuum cleaners.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241211021400 +0000" stop="20241211030800 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>It’s Gordon’s greatest challenge to date, as he continues to uncover problem after problem at Vermont’s Juniper Hill Inn.
