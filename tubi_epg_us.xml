Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241201060000 +0000" stop="20241201080000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241201080000 +0000" stop="20241201090000 +0000"><title>Price of Fame: The Liam Payne Story -- A Special Edition of 20/20</title><desc>Exploring Liam Payne's meteoric rise to celebrity as a member of boy band One Direction and his personal journey, including his struggles with mental health and the pressures of stardom.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241201090000 +0000" stop="20241201110000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241201110000 +0000" stop="20241201130000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241201130000 +0000" stop="20241201133000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241201133000 +0000" stop="20241201140000 +0000"><title>GMA Life</title><desc>A weekly roundup of the best lifestyle content from "Good Morning America"; includes exclusive celebrity content, savings from "Deals &amp; Steals," and interviews with authors behind some of the most anticipated books.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241201140000 +0000" stop="20241201143000 +0000"><title>Good Morning America - Top Stories</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241201143000 +0000" stop="20241201150000 +0000"><title>GMA Life</title><desc>A weekly roundup of the best lifestyle content from "Good Morning America"; includes exclusive celebrity content, savings from "Deals &amp; Steals," and interviews with authors behind some of the most anticipated books.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241201150000 +0000" stop="20241201153000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekends</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241201153000 +0000" stop="20241201160000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241201160000 +0000" stop="20241201163000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekends</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241201163000 +0000" stop="20241201170000 +0000"><title>GMA Life</title><desc>A weekly roundup of the best lifestyle content from "Good Morning America"; includes exclusive celebrity content, savings from "Deals &amp; Steals," and interviews with authors behind some of the most anticipated books.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241201170000 +0000" stop="20241201180000 +0000"><title>This Week With George Stephanopoulos</title><desc>Former Clinton White House staffer and current co-anchor of ABC's weekday morning news show "Good Morning America," George Stephanopoulos and co-anchors Martha Raddatz and Jonathan Karl offer a look at current events with a focus on the politics of the day.

Owner CHARITA JONES was producing a menu of irresistible unique classics from the Deep South, but at the same facing financial disaster. The punters were missing, and so was her business acumen. But Gordon succeeded in shutting her out of the kitchen, getting the chef back on the boil and putting the soul back into the business.

Today Charita is fully-booked round the clock and bursting out of the Soul Shack to take on the 110-seater Momma Cherri's Big House. But expansion brings a different set of challenges, and she's still struggling to control her staff and manage her success. Has she got what it takes to make the next step up, or will she be forced to rethink her grand plans?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241202060000 +0000" stop="20241202070000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's penultimate programme Gordon returns to La Riviera - now renamed Abstract - a fine dining restaurant in Inverness. Owned by multi-millionaire Barry Larson and costing ~£8000 a week to run, the place boasted top French chef Loic Lefebvre and an impeccably-trained kitchen staff, all of them on a mission to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of the haggis. But the locals weren't biting and the restaurant was empty most nights. Gordon's recipe for survival forced them to tone down their act and demystify the menu to get the punters in. Today the restaurant's return to form has led to plans for expansion. Loic is still there, and now he's been promoted to Executive Chef he will oversee any new ventures. But can he continue to resist a return to French frills, and has he managed to pull off his own personal ambition, a Michelin star?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241202070000 +0000" stop="20241202080000 +0000"><title>Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Cookery Course</title><desc>S01:E05 - Food on a Budget</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241202080000 +0000" stop="20241202090000 +0000"><title>Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Cookery Course</title><desc>S01:E06 - Baking</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241202090000 +0000" stop="20241202100000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Tonight, for the first time ever on Kitchen Nightmares, Gordon takes on a nightmare restaurant abroad.

A former waitress at the restaurant, Rachel bought it three years ago and now, along with best friend Stephanie, she's trying to convert the carnivorous French into a nation of veggies. For Gordon it's a sentimental journey to the city where he spent his formative years as a chef, a food mecca full of gastronomic delights that should be a dream.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241201133200 +0000" stop="20241201143200 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's penultimate programme is The Curry Lounge in Nottingham, the city with more restaurants per square mile than any other in Britain. This 120-seater Indian restaurant has been run since January by ex sales director Raz who's new to the business - and it shows. Despite a ~500k refurbishment and décor like a Bollywood set the honeymoon period's well and truly over. His once-healthy trade is evaporating and at his current rate of loss it's uncertain he'll make it past Christmas.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241201143200 +0000" stop="20241201153100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241201153100 +0000" stop="20241201163000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241201163000 +0000" stop="20241201173000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241201173000 +0000" stop="20241201182100 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Harper’s Ferry in West Virginia, to try to save a historic hotel that’s desperately in need of help.
