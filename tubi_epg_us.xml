The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies.

Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large. The detectives soon have to delve into a world of rock music, drug use and greed, to find the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20241217130000 +0000" stop="20241217150000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The suspicious death of popular young GP Dr Alan Delaney brings Barnaby and Jones to Midsomer Market to investigate. The detectives are baffled as to a motive for murder - until they consider that the newly engaged Dr James Kirkwood may have been the intended victim. Before long, Barnaby and Jones are heading to Wales - former home to Delyth Mostyn, James's fiancee, to delve deeper into the mystery. There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20241217150000 +0000" stop="20241217170000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village. The dispute seems harmless enough - until Lionel Bell is found murdered in a nearby woodland, strangled with the cord of his light meter. Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation. Barnaby is forced to work off the case to uncover who is framing him, and who wants dead other photographers in the village.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20241217170000 +0000" stop="20241217190000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The residents of Midsomer Magna are thrilled when a production crew arrives at the local manor house to film a version of The Scarlet Pimpernel.

It soon becomes clear that things are not so simple, and the detectives soon have to shift through varying motives, layered by lies, hidden truths, and a possible robbery to be committed.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20241217190000 +0000" stop="20241217200000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>The CSI team, with the help of local tipsters, fights to save a neighborhood on the brink of being taken over by a violent street gang.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20241217200000 +0000" stop="20241217210000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>The CSI team uses radical technology to unlock the secrets of a man's mind when he shows up covered in blood with no memory of where he has been.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20241217210000 +0000" stop="20241217220000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>When a murder occurs during a horse race, Horatio discovers that Ryan has a personal connection to the case.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20241217220000 +0000" stop="20241217230000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>Alexx Wood comes back when a murderer puts Ryan's and Calleigh's lives at risk.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20241217230000 +0000" stop="20241218000000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>The CSI team makes a shocking discovery about its murder victim; Horatio tries to save his son from Julia's erratic behavior.</desc></programme><channel id="700415"><display-name>Midsomer Murders</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/IBJGS19NTeYu4g==/34fa2e5d-6c68-4012-8c19-cc4afe6ad726/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjJAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="700415" start="20241216190200 +0000" stop="20241216205100 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The discovery of a Saint's bones at an archaeological dig causes a stir in the village of Midsomer Cicely.
