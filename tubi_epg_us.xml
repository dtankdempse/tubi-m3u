He manages the legendary Coca-Cola Woods property in McCrory, Arkansas, has his own line of Echo Duck calls and has placed in the World‚Äôs Championship Duck Calling Contest time and again. Further, his skills and expertise have been showcased on many duck hunting shows and podcasts. Yet despite his success as a professional duck hunter, Creasey says managing the Coca-Cola Woods is what he loves most. Known for offering some of the best green timber duck hunting in the Mid-South, the Coca-Cola property was originally bought by the family who owned the Coca-Cola bottling company and turned into a duck club in 1937. Creasey stresses the importance of thanking folks who‚Äôve had a positive impact in your life. ‚ÄúWhoever took you and got you started in the outdoors, if they are still around, thank them,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThank them while you still can. My uncle got sick with cancer. I told my mama I want to thank him for everything he did. Little league games. Fishing. And I had that opportunity. I wrote him a birthday card and told him how much he meant to me. He told me that was the best birthday present he ever got. A month later, he lost his battle with cancer, but I had that closure and was able to thank him.‚Äù He says since 2002, he‚Äôs made a point to thank everyone who has meant anything to him. ‚ÄúMy daddy,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúLost him in 2018. Last thing I told him was I loved him. Thanked him. He was my hero. If I leave you with anything, do this for me. Thank whoever it is. Be it your mama, your daddy, your uncle or your grandpa. Hug their neck, and thank them for all they‚Äôve done for you.

He manages the legendary Coca-Cola Woods property in McCrory, Arkansas, has his own line of Echo Duck calls and has placed in the World‚Äôs Championship Duck Calling Contest time and again. Further, his skills and expertise have been showcased on many duck hunting shows and podcasts. Yet despite his success as a professional duck hunter, Creasey says managing the Coca-Cola Woods is what he loves most. Known for offering some of the best green timber duck hunting in the Mid-South, the Coca-Cola property was originally bought by the family who owned the Coca-Cola bottling company and turned into a duck club in 1937. Creasey stresses the importance of thanking folks who‚Äôve had a positive impact in your life. ‚ÄúWhoever took you and got you started in the outdoors, if they are still around, thank them,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThank them while you still can. My uncle got sick with cancer. I told my mama I want to thank him for everything he did. Little league games. Fishing. And I had that opportunity. I wrote him a birthday card and told him how much he meant to me. He told me that was the best birthday present he ever got. A month later, he lost his battle with cancer, but I had that closure and was able to thank him.‚Äù He says since 2002, he‚Äôs made a point to thank everyone who has meant anything to him. ‚ÄúMy daddy,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúLost him in 2018. Last thing I told him was I loved him. Thanked him. He was my hero. If I leave you with anything, do this for me. Thank whoever it is. Be it your mama, your daddy, your uncle or your grandpa. Hug their neck, and thank them for all they‚Äôve done for you.

La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128023100 +0000" stop="20241128033400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire. The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~¬£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128033400 +0000" stop="20241128043500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~¬£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128043500 +0000" stop="20241128053800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele.
