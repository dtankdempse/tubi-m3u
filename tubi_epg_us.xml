game shows. This week we are forced to take notice of Demolition Dave, a 49 yr old South Australia man who thanks to some home training smashes the qualifier. For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241014100621 +0000" stop="20241014110139 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>This week contestants on Wipeout Australia are bought undone by a seemingly simple obstacle on the Qualifier, the Slippery Stairs. It’s all in the name really, an innocent set of stairs, covered in Wipeout Crash cream. Its up the way and down the way for all and sundry. The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris. It’s a colourful week with leotards, laughs and lots of ladies.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241014110139 +0000" stop="20241014115745 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>Fashion comes to Wipeout Australia as we meet Adam “God’s Gift” Marshall, a self styled Ad man who conquers the Qualifier. Other Catwalk moments include the Grandpa in his Red Speedos and a Rainbow Bright Personal Ad. If jumping a revolving arm while balancing on a pedestal above water isn’t enough for you then you’ll love this weeks Sweeper. Contestants are armed with Dodgeballs, to be deployed at each other, creating horrific hits and spectacular spills. The Dizzy Dummy claims its first victim as Dummy Tummy rejects a contestant and the Wipeout Zone becomes a battle of young and old.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241014115745 +0000" stop="20241014131058 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>This is the 'Legends Special' with all of the worst but funniest competitors from the last three series.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241014131058 +0000" stop="20241014142609 +0000"><title>Program information currently unavailable.</title></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241014142609 +0000" stop="20241014153934 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In this episode, twenty intrepid contestants take on four gruelling obstacles.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241014153934 +0000" stop="20241014163401 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>Showdowns don’t come more epic than this.

Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in "fine dining", he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241014050000 +0000" stop="20241014060000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Saturday night at The Glass House Restaurant in Ambleside was a disaster.

Hundreds of citizens and police officers fanned out across the region, hoping to find some trace of the young girl or her abductor.  Within hours, a suspect emerged; a drifter who was out on parole for abducting and molesting children.  He was nowhere to be found and time had run out for the innocent child.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241015201100 +0000" stop="20241015211600 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>On February 3, 1990, a 14-year-old girl ran away from her mother's home and disappeared without a trace.  Her mother hoped Pasadena, Texas police could find her before it was too late.  Six months later, their worst fear was realized when a farmer discovered the young girl's remains in an Illinois barn.  The FBI was called in to help.  Agents tracked down a trucker who they believed was responsible for 50 more deaths.  Investigators knew they had to stop this menace of the highways.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241015211600 +0000" stop="20241015222100 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A Labor Day weekend turned into a nightmare of murder as a cross-country crime spree terrorized the nation.  In a small Ohio community, an elderly woman and a teenage boy disappeared within hours of each other.  Police believed the cases were linked, but didn't know how. They contacted the FBI for help.  A trail of stolen vehicles and murder victims across seven states led agents on a hunt for two suspected killers. Their only hope of stopping them was to anticipate the killers' next move.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241015222100 +0000" stop="20241015232700 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>The rapes and murders of ten women near Tampa, Florida in 1984 had the authorities puzzled and the community scared.   Since the beginning, the FBI had been analyzing the crime scene evidence and had found a common link: red trilobal carpet fibers.  But there was no suspect, until one of the killer's potential victims survived.  Through her interviews and the cooperation of local authorities and the FBI, 31-year-old Bobby Joe Long emerged as the prime suspect.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241015232700 +0000" stop="20241016003000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>After a series of brutal bank robberies and murders in south Miami during the mid-1980's, the FBI embarked on an exhaustive eight-month investigation.  With little evidence and no suspects, agents were willing to try anything to find the violent perpetrators.  On April 11, 1986, agents conducting routine surveillance spotted the vehicle used in the bank robberies.  They attempted to arrest the two suspects in the car.  What followed was the bloodiest firefight in FBI history.</desc></programme><channel id="692086"><display-name>FilmRise True Crime</display-name><icon src="https://canvas.tubitv.com/opts/aEDjg8PFRVs6fg==/83aa1731-c6a7-42d6-b797-1d2210b665ec/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjJAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="692086" start="20241014001400 +0000" stop="20241014011200 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Prisoners</title><desc>The story of Tyler Davis Bingham, pretty criminal turned leader of the brutal and feared Aryan Brotherhood.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241014011200 +0000" stop="20241014020700 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>A double murderer is found guilty of the brutal assassination of an elderly couple.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241014020700 +0000" stop="20241014030500 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>An in-depth look at some of the world's most dangerous murderers.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241014030500 +0000" stop="20241014035900 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>An in-depth look at some of the world's most dangerous murderers.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241014035900 +0000" stop="20241014045600 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>Manipulative, psychopathic and callous, church warden Ben Field killed Peter Farquhar and even penned a list of 100 future victims.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241014045600 +0000" stop="20241014055600 +0000"><title>Killers: Caught on Camera</title><desc>A dead woman in a car is linked to two brothers.
