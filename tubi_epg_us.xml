La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241120185200 +0000" stop="20241120195500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire. The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241120195500 +0000" stop="20241120205700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241120205700 +0000" stop="20241120215500 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage are tasked with refloating a pre-World War II boat, but on the way to the site, team leader Luke receives an emergency SOS about another mission.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241120215500 +0000" stop="20241120225300 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage are tasked with refloating a pre-World War II boat, but on the way to the site, team leader Luke receives an emergency SOS about another mission.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241120225300 +0000" stop="20241120234700 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits the Cambridge Hotel, New York, where ex-military man John Imhof and his wife, Tina, own and run the allegedly haunted Cambridge Hotel.
