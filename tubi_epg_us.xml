We learn about Carolina Skiffs and visit Grady-White in Greenville, then meet some professional boat cinematographers and local custom Carolina sport fishing yacht dealers. Finally we stop in Washington to reminisce about the early days of powerboat racing with champion Reggie Fountain, who regales viewers with tales of beating Don Johnson, Kurt Russell, Al Copeland and Chuck Norris while setting speed records and capturing the title of the fastest V-bottom boat in the world. From go-fast speed boats to family cruising we see some of what makes North Carolina‚Äôs storied boating culture unique and special.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241030230020 +0000" stop="20241030233011 +0000"><title>Primos</title><desc>The Primos Team hunts giant elk in the prairies and mountains of New Mexico.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241030233011 +0000" stop="20241031000005 +0000"><title>Deer and Deer Hunting</title><desc>In this educational episode, we head to the Hornady headquarters in Nebraska to explore the history and evolution of popular calibers</desc></programme><channel id="400000000"><display-name>Waypoint TV</display-name><icon src="https://canvas.tubitv.com/opts/_tywrgSMjK51fg==/4b2bb660-9424-45c9-ad67-9c7099f60cbf/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjJAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000000" start="20241029013000 +0000" stop="20241029020001 +0000"><title>Into The Blue</title><desc>It only takes 3 fish to fill the Yeti cooler when Capt Scott fishes the top with kites for Wahoo and Steve pulls a big Mutton Snapper off the bottom.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241029020001 +0000" stop="20241029023001 +0000"><title>The Cast</title><desc>Trenton stays close to home and heads to the Lake of The Ozarks joining Austin Culbertson for a frigid couple days of fishing.

On this adventure, Mark is toting his Gunwerks BlastR handgun as he hunts the swamps with his sights set on a big mature gator. Alligators are typically judged in the field by looking at the distance from their eyes to the tip of their nose. The rule of thumb is that they grow a foot in length every year until they are eight years old, then grown an inch per year after that. At 13 feet 3 inches, this old gator is one for the books.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241030081141 +0000" stop="20241030083024 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Mark Peterson is duck hunting for the 4th day in Argentina and finds that luck is on his side.

Police stopped suspects nearby and another shoot-out ensued, claiming the lives of two officers.  Local police and the FBI suspected a large group of domestic terrorists with a history of violent crime.  They would try to ferret out these heavily armed criminals who moved in a shadowy underworld and were not afraid to kill authorities.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241030130100 +0000" stop="20241030140800 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>Two couples found themselves on the same deserted island paradise.

When the bank president was nowhere to be found, the residents were outraged.  The FBI discovered that things are not always as they appear.  Minute clues led the agents to the body of the bank president.  With no suspects, the FBI relied on dogged determination and modern forensics.

The stakes were raised when the FBI discovered the robbers had an agenda beyond their personal wealth.

Fifty blue acrylic fibers collected during a search of Hughes' car, however, became the major piece of evidence in the case.

Six black males had been brutally murdered--two had their hearts cut out.  The only thing connecting the victims was their ethnicity and the fact that each had been shot with .22 caliber bullets. Residents screamed for the police to stop this serial killer.  With no suspects, local investigators turned to the FBI.  Profilers were able to produce a psychological composite of the type of person the killer would most likely be.
