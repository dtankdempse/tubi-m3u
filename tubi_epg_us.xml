The contestant, known as the One, competes with a mob of 100 other players by answering questions. When the One answers correctly, each member of the mob that answered incorrectly is eliminated. The One earns money for each mob member who is eliminated. If the One can eliminate the entire mob, he wins $50,000. But if the One gets a question wrong, he is eliminated and the remaining mob members split his winnings.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20241112151600 +0000" stop="20241112154200 +0000"><title>Tug of Words</title><desc>Based on the playground game Tug-O-War, teams of two compete to answer word-clue questions correctly and pull the flag on the tug of war rope to their side.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20241112154200 +0000" stop="20241112160800 +0000"><title>Tug of Words</title><desc>Based on the playground game Tug-O-War, teams of two compete to answer word-clue questions correctly and pull the flag on the tug of war rope to their side.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20241112160800 +0000" stop="20241112163400 +0000"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey assumes the hosting duties for this daytime game show in which five members of one family are pitted against five members of another family.

Surrounded by water, Key West is a boater's paradise with historic seaports and marinas offering a bustling waterfront with historic schooners, dive boats, sport fishing charters, parasailing adventures and scenic coastal excursions. Host Ryan McVinney hops aboard a custom hybrid diesel-electric power catamaran with solar panels, called "Squid" for an in-depth eco-tour of Key West National Wildlife Refuge, including snorkeling in a sponge garden with tropical fish. Next a quick stop in Dry Tortugas National Park via the 110-foot Gladding Hearn power catamaran the "Yankee Freedom III" to visit historic Fort Jefferson, then we jump on a 2020 Sea Hunt 255 Ultra for a ride through the dolphin playground to a secret local boating spot known as Snipe Keys with pristine white sandbars. Back in town we we board the Nau Santa Maria - a replica of Christopher Columbus' sailboat. Finally we head 50 miles offshore to ply the wakes of the shrimp boats with fishing charter captain Chris Trosset aboard his Contender 35ST center console boat.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241113235702 +0000" stop="20241114002653 +0000"><title>Primos</title><desc>The Primos Team hunts giant elk in the prairies and mountains of New Mexico.</desc></programme><channel id="400000065"><display-name>Top Gear</display-name><icon src="https://canvas.tubitv.com/opts/K8HQEXhF_Iy_eQ==/30a1f8b9-c414-4d47-a7ec-4f4f6792aed2/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjJAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000065" start="20241112012729 +0000" stop="20241112023617 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK</title><desc>The presenters give their moms a chance to shine as they test a range of small cars.

Shortly before leaving their hotel they mention they haven't been able to find what they're looking for; "something old and derelict that they can do up." Anne Merrick tells them about Winyard, a tumbledown cottage in the woods, might be for sale. At the estate agents they are told the house is not yet available for viewing. Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter. The next morning they are found strangled in their own car. DCI Barnaby starts the investigation with the help of PC Ben Jones and they come across the world of estate agents, identical twins, ghosts, piano wire, and more before another body turns up.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241112234800 +0000" stop="20241113014100 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Villagers of Midsomer Barton are all set to celebrate Oak Apple Week, especially as the carnival queen event is set to return after an eight year absence.

A few months on, there have been some departures from the Glass House. Who is in charge of the kitchen now?

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241113014400 +0000" stop="20241113025000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Nick and Richard are self-confessed restaurant virgins.  They've both had successful careers in the brewery business so when they bought Moore Place they believed they could make it an instant success.  What they hadn't realized was just how difficult it would be to fill the 90-seater oak-paneled restaurant and how hard it would be to find a chef who could cook decent food.

Has Ramsay's fast-track guide to restaurant success helped these brewery whiz-kids transform their failing ex-Berni Inn into a profitable business? And is the building still painted that disgusting shade of purple?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241113025000 +0000" stop="20241113035400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The episode that has gone down in TV history. Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in "fine dining", he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241113035400 +0000" stop="20241113044800 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Harper’s Ferry in West Virginia, to try to save a historic hotel that’s desperately in need of help.

This is Lois and Peter's first venture into the catering industry - the happily married couple used to enjoy eating in restaurants, so thought it might be fun to own one. 18months later their dream has turned into a nightmare and they're loosing ~£4,000 a month.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241113204100 +0000" stop="20241113214400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>This week Gordon is at a god-awful Italian restaurant in Derby. La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241113214400 +0000" stop="20241113223800 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage
