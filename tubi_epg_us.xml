Temps are abnormally hot in Argentina for this time of year and the animals will be heading for cover by mid day to stay cool.

Here, Mark takes you back to 2017 to the first (and still only) filmed hunt for Blue Sheep in Northern Pakistan. It's ironic that his most challenging and physically brutal hunt is also the one that holds the number one spot in Mark's hunting career.

For this leg of the journey, he is chasing after Water Buffalo, Wild Boar and Axis Deer. Argentina's borders were closed during the peak of COVID, so these animals have not been hunted for two years, which led to a game rich environment and excellent trophy quality. Mark and his guide Charly are in the action right away and it doesn't take long for them to spot the animals they were looking for and make their move.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241219142911 +0000" stop="20241219145846 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Mark Peterson is still in Argentina but has moved locations from La Pampa to Patagonia in search of a Pere David's Deer.

Taking four animals, this is one of the best morning hunts he has had yet. After an already incredible week of hunting, Mark is looking for a few species that caught his attention earlier in the trip and turns up a Hybrid Sheep, Hybrid Mouflon, Feral Goat and a Multi Horn Sheep. Temps are abnormally hot in Argentina for this time of year and the animals will be heading for cover by mid day to stay cool. Mark and his guide Charley make a plan to cover a lot of ground in hopes of catching them out feeding before they disappear.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241219152823 +0000" stop="20241219155809 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Hunting off the northeastern coast of Australia on Marble island could be one of the most beautiful sceneries in the world.

That answer would quickly be followed up with "Blue Sheep Hunting in Pakistan, hands down". Here, Mark takes you back to 2017 to the first (and still only) filmed hunt for Blue Sheep in Northern Pakistan. It's ironic that his most challenging and physically brutal hunt is also the one that holds the number one spot in Mark's hunting career.

The company is thinking about increasing Tom's exposure by producing a new television show around him. Liz Madison is the advice columnist for the little read community newspaper, the Marin County Voice, which is a throwback to gentler times. Besides their journalistic occupations, one other similar aspect between Tom and Liz is that they are both currently single, with their friends and family doing whatever they can to find that special someone for their personal life. On November 2, the staff at the Voice learn that the Sun ownership has bought their newspaper, with the probable goal of folding it into the operations of the Sun. If this move does happen, the staff at the Voice will lose their jobs. To fight back, Liz decides to change her column to an editorial espousing the meaning of Christmas and the newspaper to the community.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241219033058 +0000" stop="20241219052003 +0000"><title>A Vineyard Christmas</title><desc>TV host Heather tries to make the perfect Christmas episode but clashes with the winery owner.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241219052003 +0000" stop="20241219070521 +0000"><title>Christmas Cupid's Arrow</title><desc>Holly, a single college professor, signs up for an online dating service, but begins to grow suspicious when the guy's beautifully-written texts don't match his actions.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241219070521 +0000" stop="20241219085523 +0000"><title>Candid About Love</title><desc>Laura must get reclusive artist Shane to premiere his work at a gallery to help her own career.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241219085523 +0000" stop="20241219104029 +0000"><title>The Love Hunt</title><desc>A real estate exec and a farmer team up to find hidden treasure and love.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241219104029 +0000" stop="20241219110927 +0000"><title>New Dogs, Old Tricks</title><desc>It's the day of the Gamma Fair, but Sarah doesn't want to go.

Anne Merrick tells them about Winyard, a tumbledown cottage in the woods, might be for sale. At the estate agents they are told the house is not yet available for viewing. Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter.

It seems the club has a rift between the snobbish members, and local villagers, the latter only allowed onto the course for a few hours a week. Before long, another member turns up dead, and the detectives soon find the club has a hidden history, involving gambling, illegal money lending and assault, prompting the pair to determine if a club member, or one of its staff, is responsible for the deeds.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241219122500 +0000" stop="20241219141200 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>A newly discovered masterpiece by landscape artist Henry Hogson causes a stir when it is auctioned for  £400,000 - just hours before its former owner is tortured and killed.

Geoffrey is soon gashed to death after a cricket match in Midsomer Parva, and the locals blame the 'beast of Midsomer'. However, Barnaby - a former spy himself - soon realises that the killing has links to Allenby House and Cold War Berlin, but is initially thrown off the case by MI6.

During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large.

To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains.
