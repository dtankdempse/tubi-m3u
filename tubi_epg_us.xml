Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241103140000 +0000" stop="20241103150000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241103150000 +0000" stop="20241103160000 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>S02:E02 - Cambodia</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241103160000 +0000" stop="20241103170000 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>S02:E03 - Malaysia</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241103170000 +0000" stop="20241103180000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue is The Runaway Girl, a tapas bar-cum-nightclub in Sheffield city centre on the brink of collapse. The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241103180000 +0000" stop="20241103190000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point. The restaurant is on its last legs - they've run out of customers, money and hope. Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241103190000 +0000" stop="20241103200000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S05:E10 - Episode 10</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241103200000 +0000" stop="20241103210000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S05:E11 - Episode 11</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241103210000 +0000" stop="20241103220000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's final programme is The Granary in rural Hampshire, an upmarket restaurant which - at 200 seats - is the biggest Gordon's ever taken on. Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241103220000 +0000" stop="20241103230000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241103230000 +0000" stop="20241104000000 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>S02:E02 - Cambodia</desc></programme><channel id="700409"><display-name>Great British Menu</display-name><icon src="https://canvas.tubitv.com/opts/ybfMXHANHz8iNQ==/c1decf91-5c6b-4d2d-96d2-b46e4e0a95ca/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjJAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="700409" start="20241102004500 +0000" stop="20241102015400 +0000"><title>Great British Menu</title><desc>In the competitive finals, the remaining eight chefs must prepare their starter dish to impress the judges.</desc></programme><programme channel="700409" start="20241102015400 +0000" stop="20241102030300 +0000"><title>Great British Menu</title><desc>The eight winners of the regional heats prepare to cook their fish dishes, which will be tasted and scored by the `Great British Menu' judges and veteran judge Marcus Wareing.

This area was the home to the Nestucca peoples and other coastal tribes until the mid-1800s when the population was decimated by diseases from settlers. Those who remained were coerced into a coastal reservation by the US government.

When he’s not rucking to and from the GORUCK HQ, you can find him and his friends putting on grueling garage workouts that are the talk of the neighborhood. Huckberry and GORUCK go way back, we’ve shared plenty of good times, GORUCK Challenges, and (more than) a few beers along the way. Their military-grade lineup is designed to be taken to hell and back in the field. So whether you’re traveling the world or “embracing the suck” with a 30 LB plate in your rucksack, you can be sure your gear’s up to the challenge."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241103164709 +0000" stop="20241103170032 +0000"><title>Huckberry Homes</title><desc>"For our second episode of Huckberry Homes, we set our sights on the Oregon coast and flew out to see our friends ‪@ben_moon‬ and Sophie Kuller. Tired of fixing up other people's houses, Ben decided to spend the last few years crafting his own house from the ground up, while getting help from his friends, Dad, and Sophie along the way. This one-of-a-kind home now serves as a gathering place for creatives and surfers alike, nestled between the forest and Oregon coast.On Huckberry Homes, we’ll be tapping into the most inspiring members of the Huckberry community to offer an inside peek into how they’ve crafted the place they call home. We will showcase everything from cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that inspire creativity and high-performing lives.We would like to take a moment to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples who have stewarded the land on which this video was created. This area was the home to the Nestucca peoples and other coastal tribes until the mid-1800s when the population was decimated by diseases from settlers. Those who remained were coerced into a coastal reservation by the US government. Let us remember the histories and cultures that have shaped this land."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241103170032 +0000" stop="20241103173020 +0000"><title>Life On The Water</title><desc>Brandon Simmons take the family to the Pink Shell Resort in Ft.

Their investigation introduces Barnaby and Troy to many eccentric and quirky residents and soon turns up a web of sex, blackmail and lies, and the possibility that the murder could be connected to a shooting accident two years ago, which claimed another woman's life.</desc></programme><channel id="671073"><display-name>Unsolved Mysteries</display-name><icon src="https://canvas.tubitv.com/opts/Qx5hBhnp1aNAZg==/864892f9-3ab0-4950-9f8b-189ec2d92c20/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjJAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="671073" start="20241102005800 +0000" stop="20241102020200 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Gracias Capitán Sharp, Harold y Ma, Sobre el Borde &amp; Actualización y Ogo Pogo.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241102020200 +0000" stop="20241102030200 +0000"><title>Program information currently unavailable.</title></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241102030200 +0000" stop="20241102040000 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Túnel del Banco, Vida Después de la Vida Partes 1 &amp; 2, Actualización: Heredero de Red Lake y Muerte del Reparador.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241102040000 +0000" stop="20241102050200 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Oklahoma City Rescuers, UD: Baby Given Away, Carolina Cop Killer &amp; UD, Vince Foster and Crime Novelist.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241102050200 +0000" stop="20241102055900 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Direct Contact, Green River Killer &amp; UD, Foster Son &amp; UD and Murder in Connecticut &amp; UD.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241102055900 +0000" stop="20241102065400 +0000"><title>Program information currently unavailable.</title></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241102065400 +0000" stop="20241102075300 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Ice Woman, Airline Employee Murder, Silicon Valley Hit, Florida Crime Spree &amp; UD and Elvis, The Twinless Twin.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241102075300 +0000" stop="20241102084600 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: El Tesoro de Dutch Shultz, Asesino de Estafas de Computadoras, Lauren Perdida y Asesino de Madre / Hijo &amp; Actualización.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241102084600 +0000" stop="20241102094300 +0000"><title>Program information currently unavailable.</title></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241102094300 +0000" stop="20241102104200 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: El Barco Fantasma Queen Mary, Actualización: Carlucci, Dos Strikes &amp; Actualización y Personales Pts. 1 &amp; 2 &amp; Actualización.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241102104200 +0000" stop="20241102113900 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Socorro Close Encounter, UD: Car Crash Thank You, Kentucky Visions, Foster Twins &amp; UD and Elevator Murder.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241102113900 +0000" stop="20241102123900 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Brandon Lee, Missing Anchorwoman, First Love, Second Chance &amp; UD, Killer Castro and Gulf P.O.W.

La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241103013900 +0000" stop="20241103024100 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire.

The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241103034300 +0000" stop="20241103044500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool.
