From Roald Amundsen’s 1911 voyage to the South Pole to Sir Edmund Hillary’s ascent to the summit of Mount Everest to astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s history-changing 1969 expedition to the moon, the halls of this institution have echoed with tales of daring discovery and unparalleled human achievement. That’s why we’re beyond stoked to kick off our Huckberry x The Explorers Club partnership—featuring the Land, Sea, and Space Collection from an exclusive Whiskey Peaks collab and a badass grand prize.
