Tired of fixing up other people's houses, Ben decided to spend the last few years crafting his own house from the ground up, while getting help from his friends, Dad, and Sophie along the way. This one-of-a-kind home now serves as a gathering place for creatives and surfers alike, nestled between the forest and Oregon coast.On Huckberry Homes, we’ll be tapping into the most inspiring members of the Huckberry community to offer an inside peek into how they’ve crafted the place they call home. We will showcase everything from cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that inspire creativity and high-performing lives.We would like to take a moment to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples who have stewarded the land on which this video was created. This area was the home to the Nestucca peoples and other coastal tribes until the mid-1800s when the population was decimated by diseases from settlers. Those who remained were coerced into a coastal reservation by the US government. Let us remember the histories and cultures that have shaped this land."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241123031756 +0000" stop="20241123033026 +0000"><title>Gear Lab</title><desc>Embracing passion.
