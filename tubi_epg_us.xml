But if the One gets a question wrong, he is eliminated and the remaining mob members split his winnings.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20241009111600 +0000" stop="20241009114200 +0000"><title>Tug of Words</title><desc>Based on the playground game Tug-O-War, teams of two compete to answer word-clue questions correctly and pull the flag on the tug of war rope to their side.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20241009114200 +0000" stop="20241009120800 +0000"><title>Tug of Words</title><desc>Based on the playground game Tug-O-War, teams of two compete to answer word-clue questions correctly and pull the flag on the tug of war rope to their side.</desc></programme><programme channel="673411" start="20241009120800 +0000" stop="20241009123400 +0000"><title>Family Feud</title><desc>Steve Harvey assumes the hosting duties for this daytime game show in which five members of one family are pitted against five members of another family.

Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241010210501 +0000" stop="20241010215946 +0000"><title>Program information currently unavailable.</title></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241010215946 +0000" stop="20241010231247 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>This is the last episode of the season and the 8 previous winners compete to be the Champion of Champions.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241010231247 +0000" stop="20241011000738 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>From singing Pastors to Wookies, this week is jammed pack with Characters, who battle it out on the Qualifier with amusing attempts at the inconceivable Field Goal Swing. Its no easy task to earn a spot in the Wipeout Zone this week with the Dreadmill, sorting the men from the boys. Contestants must dodge the wrecking ball while shooting basketballs. Although there is one man who came prepared, Dodgeball Champion Dan Bennett, whose “Duck, Dive, Dip, Dodge and Dunk” training comes into play.</desc></programme><channel id="691129"><display-name>America's Test Kitchen</display-name><icon src="https://canvas.tubitv.com/opts/nvpZEw2PEVNvlw==/9804e812-0cda-4c43-b18e-ed951546a0b6/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjJAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="691129" start="20241009002959 +0000" stop="20241009005959 +0000"><title>America's Test Kitchen</title><desc>Orange, Cranberry, and Mint Pavlova, Holiday Eggnog;

The rule of thumb is that they grow a foot in length every year until they are eight years old, then grown an inch per year after that.

Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241009142500 +0000" stop="20241009151900 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Applegate, Oregon, to try to rescue the failing Applegate River Lodge.

La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241010122400 +0000" stop="20241010132400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Priory, a 100-seater carvery in Haywards Heath, Sussex owned by ex IT consultant Scott. The former chapel of a nineteenth-century convent, the restaurant is in a spectacularly beautiful location and offers bargain roast dinners from a carvery that's been running for twenty years. Scott bought the place for £300k but with an ageing clientele eating for half-price, he's losing £5,000 a week.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241010132400 +0000" stop="20241010142500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire. The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241010142500 +0000" stop="20241010151900 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Applegate, Oregon, to try to rescue the failing Applegate River Lodge.

In January, a tip led agents to look into a former prison guard.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241010195300 +0000" stop="20241010205800 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In June of 1992, masked bandits pulled off a daring mid-day bank robbery.  It marked the beginning of a four-year crime wave that rocked Seattle.  With each new robbery, the bandits perfected their craft, leaving behind no evidence and escaping with hundreds and thousands of dollars.  As the robbers became increasingly violent, pressure mounted to end their reign.  With few leads, the FBI forced their own luck.  The effort put them face to face with an armed and desperate fugitive.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241010205800 +0000" stop="20241010220400 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In 1984, south Miami became the home for a sadistic serial killer.  Posing as a fashion photographer, Christopher Wilder lured young women from shopping malls with promises of fame and fortune.  Most ended up dead.  As the FBI closed in around him, Wilder took off on a cross-country murderous rampage.  The FBI added Wilder to their Most Wanted Fugitives program.  The chase was on, and Wilder ultimately lost.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241010220400 +0000" stop="20241010230800 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>Racial tensions in Buffalo in 1980 were at an all-time high.  Six black males had been brutally murdered--two had their hearts cut out.  The only thing connecting the victims was their ethnicity and the fact that each had been shot with .22 caliber bullets. Residents screamed for the police to stop this serial killer.  With no suspects, local investigators turned to the FBI.  Profilers were able to produce a psychological composite of the type of person the killer would most likely be.  Their analysis paid off.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241010230800 +0000" stop="20241011001300 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>On Mississippi's Gulf Coast, a judge and his politician wife were brutally murdered in their home.

They uncovered a corrupt local government and a group of violent criminal conspirators known as the Dixie Mafia, responsible for fraud, money laundering and murder.</desc></programme><channel id="692086"><display-name>FilmRise True Crime</display-name><icon src="https://canvas.tubitv.com/opts/aEDjg8PFRVs6fg==/83aa1731-c6a7-42d6-b797-1d2210b665ec/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjJAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="692086" start="20241009001900 +0000" stop="20241009011700 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>The story of the killer who took four lives during a killing spree after being inspired by horror films.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241009011700 +0000" stop="20241009021000 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>Billy Mansfield Jr. moved between Florida and Michigan, targeting vulnerable women and girls.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241009021000 +0000" stop="20241009030700 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>A family's worst nightmare occurs when 16-year-old Becky Watts goes missing, and is found dead days later, murdered by her own stepbrother.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241009030700 +0000" stop="20241009040400 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>A profile of the killer who, after killing 22-year-old Julie Hogg, became the first person to be convicted under revised UK double-jeopardy laws.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241009040400 +0000" stop="20241009050300 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>The story of the 23-year-old killer who murdered 17-year-old former head girl Georgia Williams in 2013.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241009050300 +0000" stop="20241009060000 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>Malcolm Green is jailed for life for the brutal murder of a Cardiff prostitute; he kills again when he is released after 18 years.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241009060000 +0000" stop="20241009065500 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>An in-depth look at some of the world's most dangerous murderers.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241009065500 +0000" stop="20241009074900 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>Billy Mansfield Jr. moved between Florida and Michigan, targeting vulnerable women and girls.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241009074900 +0000" stop="20241009084300 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>The notorious story of a man convicted of the murder of two young girls, as well as another killing at a military base.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241009084300 +0000" stop="20241009093900 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>Lee Ford kills his wife and four stepchildren in a cold-blooded murder spree over 24 hours in September 2000.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241009093900 +0000" stop="20241009103400 +0000"><title>Death Walker With Nick Groff</title><desc>Nick communicates with a malevolent spirit harming the family that's renovating a property.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241009103400 +0000" stop="20241009112900 +0000"><title>Death Walker With Nick Groff</title><desc>Nick investigates the Western Block Company in Lockport, New York.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241009112900 +0000" stop="20241009122400 +0000"><title>Death Walker With Nick Groff</title><desc>Nick tries to make contact with the spirit of a school janitor who is believed to have been murdered.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241009122400 +0000" stop="20241009131900 +0000"><title>Death Walker With Nick Groff</title><desc>Nick investigates Carrie Furnace, a historic landmark with a history of documented paranormal activity.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241009131900 +0000" stop="20241009141600 +0000"><title>Dr. G: Medical Examiner</title><desc>A woman fears the worst when her aunt stops answering her calls.
