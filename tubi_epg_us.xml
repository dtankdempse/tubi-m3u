As a result, Yami Marik becomes angered, and attacks Odion with the Millennium Rod, which weakens Odion even more. Odion doesn't give up, despite Ishizu's protests. As Marik continues his onslaught (which begins to injure Odion), Odion tells Marik's good side that together, they had conquered his evil half before, and that they could do it again. Then, he tells the good Marik that since Yami Marik was created by the good Marik's hatred, he has the power to destroy him. As Yami Marik raises the Rod to deliver the final blow, the good Marik disappears from the field, and begins fighting against Yami Marik, who struggles for control over Marik's body, and refuses to be defeated. However, Marik's good half stalls Yami Marik long enough for Yugi to activate his spell card. Yugi's Ragnarok spell succeeds in destroying (and removing to the graveyard) Ra, allowing the good Marik to regain control of his body. However, a sliver of Yami Marik reappears on the field, although this time, he is the victim. Yami Marik tries to convince the good Marik to help him seize the Millennium Items and rule the world together, but fails as Marik has decided to stop being evil and make up for his actions. Marik surrenders the duel to Yugi, which sends Yami Marik to the Shadow Realm, ending the Battle City finals. Bakura and Mai are returned from the shadow realm and Marik is reunited with his siblings, who forgive him. Yugi receives the three Egyptian God Cards. Kaiba then activates the Duel Tower's self-destruct sequence, giving everybody one hour to get off the island before it explodes.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000033" start="20241027013000 +0000" stop="20241027020000 +0000"><title>Yu-Gi-Oh!

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241026210001 +0000" stop="20241026213000 +0000"><title>Chasin' The Sun</title><desc>We return to the Ellie B and head a hundred miles offshore to repeat last year’s epic tuna bite.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

This one-of-a-kind home now serves as a gathering place for creatives and surfers alike, nestled between the forest and Oregon coast.On Huckberry Homes, we’ll be tapping into the most inspiring members of the Huckberry community to offer an inside peek into how they’ve crafted the place they call home. We will showcase everything from cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that inspire creativity and high-performing lives.We would like to take a moment to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples who have stewarded the land on which this video was created. This area was the home to the Nestucca peoples and other coastal tribes until the mid-1800s when the population was decimated by diseases from settlers. Those who remained were coerced into a coastal reservation by the US government.

A former waitress at the restaurant, Rachel bought it three years ago and now, along with best friend Stephanie, she's trying to convert the carnivorous French into a nation of veggies. For Gordon it's a sentimental journey to the city where he spent his formative years as a chef, a food mecca full of gastronomic delights that should be a dream.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241026022500 +0000" stop="20241026032800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's final programme is The Granary in rural Hampshire, an upmarket restaurant which - at 200 seats - is the biggest Gordon's ever taken on. Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241026032800 +0000" stop="20241026043000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue is The Runaway Girl, a tapas bar-cum-nightclub in Sheffield city centre on the brink of collapse. The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241026043000 +0000" stop="20241026053300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241026053300 +0000" stop="20241026063400 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241026063400 +0000" stop="20241026070200 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241026070200 +0000" stop="20241026073400 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>There’s a head on crash on a moorland road and paramedic Paul must fight to keep a critically injured teenage victim alive in mid-air.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241026073400 +0000" stop="20241026083600 +0000"><title>The Kinky Sex Survey</title><desc>Ordinary people from across the U.K. reveal their favorite fetishes, kinks and unusual sexual practices; experts explain where unusual sexual desires come from and why there's no such thing as normal.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241026083600 +0000" stop="20241026094600 +0000"><title>Addicted to Boob Jobs</title><desc>Journalist Louise Roe investigates why women in the United Kingdom have plastic surgery on their breasts not just once, but multiple times.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241026094600 +0000" stop="20241026104300 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>Two motorists are trapped in their wrecked cars after a head on crash on ice and the team face a difficult dilemma - which most needs a flight to hospital?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241026104300 +0000" stop="20241026114400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is La Lanterna in Letchworth, Hertfordshire.

They've sunk ~£150,000 of their own money into their trendy café bar which offers a vast selection of fusion cuisine. In charge is Executive Chef Philippe, producing everything from all-day breakfasts to hoi sin noodles with an astounding lack of flair; the plastic food is dire and boomerangs back from the dining room as soon as it's cooked.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241027200500 +0000" stop="20241027205900 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>The crew is towing a damaged yacht to a North Queensland boatyard.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241027205900 +0000" stop="20241027215600 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Things aren't looking good for Team Salvage as they run into an issue during a major beach rescue.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241027215600 +0000" stop="20241027225000 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay checks in to The Monticello Hotel in Longview, Washington, owned by Phillip Lovingfoss: a wealthy individual with a fleet of classic cars and a drinking problem so serious that it is threatening to destroy his hotel and his life.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241027225000 +0000" stop="20241027234400 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Applegate, Oregon, to try to rescue the failing Applegate River Lodge.

From an extensive investigation by the Viennese police, it was determined that these murders were the work of one sadistic predator.  Europe was dealing with a serial killer.  With no experience with this kind of predator, Viennese police turned to the FBI. FBI profilers were able to identify a suspect in the murders.  More ominously, they linked this same killer to murders committed in the United States.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241027162300 +0000" stop="20241027172600 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In Langley, Virginia, a gunman fired into rush hour traffic.
