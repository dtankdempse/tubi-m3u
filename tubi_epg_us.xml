New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant.

La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241031210800 +0000" stop="20241031221100 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire. The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~¬£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241031221100 +0000" stop="20241031231300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~¬£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241031231300 +0000" stop="20241101001500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool.

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241101052600 +0000" stop="20241101062800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~¬£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241101062800 +0000" stop="20241101072900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue is The Runaway Girl, a tapas bar-cum-nightclub in Sheffield city centre on the brink of collapse. The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241101072900 +0000" stop="20241101083100 +0000"><title>The Kinky Sex Survey</title><desc>Ordinary people from across the U.K. reveal their favorite fetishes, kinks and unusual sexual practices; experts explain where unusual sexual desires come from and why there's no such thing as normal.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241101083100 +0000" stop="20241101093100 +0000"><title>Love Me, Love My Doll</title><desc>Men who have been unable to form relationships with real women choose custom-made, life-sized dolls to serve as their romantic partners.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241101093100 +0000" stop="20241101100100 +0000"><title>Chopper Squad</title><desc>The team are being sent out to a traumatic accident that will end up being rather close to home.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241101100100 +0000" stop="20241101103100 +0000"><title>Chopper Squad</title><desc>The chopper team visits Whitianga, New Zealand, to help save a badly injured stock car driver.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241101103100 +0000" stop="20241101110200 +0000"><title>Chopper Squad</title><desc>The chopper team are about to take off to rescue a seriously injured man.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241101110200 +0000" stop="20241101113300 +0000"><title>Chopper Squad</title><desc>The chopper team responds to a life-threatening emergency.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241101113300 +0000" stop="20241101123300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers on Holiday</title><desc>The sun soaked tattoo parlor gets a visit from a man with a tattoo not mother would want to see, and a woman with a puckered up revenge tattoo.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241101123300 +0000" stop="20241101133200 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers on Holiday</title><desc>The pop-up tattoo parlor in the sun gets a visit from a woman with a mid-life crisis tattoo, and a personal trainer who needs her "best friends" ink removed.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241101133200 +0000" stop="20241101143100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers on Holiday</title><desc>A holiday-maker's manscaping stickmen, a singer's superfan, and proud parents visit the parlor; Meanwhile, a diabetic goes under the needle, while another holiday-maker gets a post-breakup tattoo.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241101143100 +0000" stop="20241101153100 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is Ruby Tates in Brighton, owned and run by ex-actor and failed Hollywood wannabe ALLAN LOVE.

Fifty blue acrylic fibers collected during a search of Hughes' car, however, became the major piece of evidence in the case. FBI fiber analysis determined that those fibers were identical to the ones that made up the sweater Melissa was wearing.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241101220800 +0000" stop="20241101231300 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>On a summer night in 1990, a body was discovered burning in a Minnesota alley.  Weeks later, police finally identified the victim, a suspected drug courier from California.  The FBI began working with local police and slowly uncovered a multi-state crime ring run by a deadly drug lord who used violence and intimidation to keep those around him silent.  Agents needed to infiltrate and dismantle the crew before more people died.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241101231300 +0000" stop="20241102001700 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>Claude Dallas lived the life of a cowboy.  A loner and distrustful of authority, he lived off the land, poaching wildlife and selling the hides.  But when two game wardens confronted Dallas about his deeds, they were shot and killed.  After a massive manhunt, Dallas was captured and convicted, only to escape months later.  Making the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list, Dallas eluded the law for almost a year until the FBI tracked him down in a small town in California.</desc></programme><channel id="692086"><display-name>FilmRise True Crime</display-name><icon src="https://canvas.tubitv.com/opts/aEDjg8PFRVs6fg==/83aa1731-c6a7-42d6-b797-1d2210b665ec/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjJAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="692086" start="20241031010100 +0000" stop="20241031015600 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>An in-depth look at some of the world's most dangerous murderers.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241031015600 +0000" stop="20241031025300 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>A killer who goaded police and media during his spree, Heriberto Seda claimed to kill based on his victims' star signs.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241031025300 +0000" stop="20241031034700 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>Examining some of the most dangerous and prolific murderers in the UK and worldwide.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241031034700 +0000" stop="20241031044400 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>An in-depth look at some of the world's most dangerous murderers.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241031044400 +0000" stop="20241031054200 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>A look at the man convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering two nine-year-old girls in 1986.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241031054200 +0000" stop="20241031063900 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>Catherine Nevin reports a break-in and violent attack at her pub, which leaves her husband dead.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241031063900 +0000" stop="20241031073400 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>A profile of the double-murderer who killed a 77-year-old teacher and a 59-year-old reverend.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241031073400 +0000" stop="20241031083100 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>The story of a killer who was infamous for his whimpering confessions over the phone after each of his murders.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241031083100 +0000" stop="20241031092900 +0000"><title>World's Most Evil Killers</title><desc>An in-depth look at some of the world's most dangerous murderers.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241031092900 +0000" stop="20241031102400 +0000"><title>Death Walker With Nick Groff</title><desc>Nick tries to determine if ghosts of priests who died seventy-four years ago are haunting the property today.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241031102400 +0000" stop="20241031111900 +0000"><title>Death Walker With Nick Groff</title><desc>Nick conducts the first-ever paranormal investigation of the Mountain Clinic, a 105-year-old vacant hospital.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241031111900 +0000" stop="20241031121400 +0000"><title>Death Walker With Nick Groff</title><desc>Nick contacts the spirit of a sentinel that's been protecting a room where Civil War veterans gathered.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241031121400 +0000" stop="20241031130900 +0000"><title>Death Walker With Nick Groff</title><desc>Nick and medium Tessa DelZoppo contact workers who died building the Edward Dean Adams Power Station.</desc></programme><programme channel="692086" start="20241031130900 +0000" stop="20241031140700 +0000"><title>Dr. G: Medical Examiner</title><desc>A daughter wants to surprise her dad with breakfast in bed but finds him unresponsive.
