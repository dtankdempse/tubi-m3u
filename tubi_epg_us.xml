Temps are abnormally hot in Argentina for this time of year and the animals will be heading for cover by mid day to stay cool.

The rule of thumb is that they grow a foot in length every year until they are eight years old, then grown an inch per year after that. At 13 feet 3 inches, this old gator is one for the books.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241016081148 +0000" stop="20241016083035 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Mark Peterson persists in his pursuit of the North American Deer Slam, setting his sights on Kentucky as his next destination with his focus on the Southeastern Whitetail.

After an already incredible week of hunting, Mark is looking for a few species that caught his attention earlier in the trip and turns up a Hybrid Sheep, Hybrid Mouflon, Feral Goat and a Multi Horn Sheep. Temps are abnormally hot in Argentina for this time of year and the animals will be heading for cover by mid day to stay cool. Mark and his guide Charley make a plan to cover a lot of ground in hopes of catching them out feeding before they disappear.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241016073012 +0000" stop="20241016075037 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Mark Peterson heads North to Alberta on a late season Elk hunt.

On this adventure, Mark is toting his Gunwerks BlastR handgun as he hunts the swamps with his sights set on a big mature gator. Alligators are typically judged in the field by looking at the distance from their eyes to the tip of their nose. The rule of thumb is that they grow a foot in length every year until they are eight years old, then grown an inch per year after that. At 13 feet 3 inches, this old gator is one for the books.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241016081148 +0000" stop="20241016083035 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Mark Peterson persists in his pursuit of the North American Deer Slam, setting his sights on Kentucky as his next destination with his focus on the Southeastern Whitetail.

After putting on many miles throughout the morning, the fog began to lift and they finally laid eyes on their target buck. Moving into position had its challenges with plenty of satellite deer around, but in the end it came together.

It is the prime example of HOW NOT TO RUN A RESTAURANT. Owner DAVE is the flakey self-appointed head chef, who hasn't been in a kitchen for 30 years and can't cook. His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce". Gordon faces a hellish week, Clubway 41 is breaking every rule in book, can he bring Dave, Dawn and their food back to earth?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241016064000 +0000" stop="20241016074000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Tonight's program sees Gordon Ramsay in Oscars in Nantwich.

She constantly bickers with her son whilst the customers are forced to wait hours for their fluorescent crab stick paellas, and stodgy carbonaras from Oscars "bit of everything" menu.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241016074000 +0000" stop="20241016085000 +0000"><title>Addicted to Boob Jobs</title><desc>Journalist Louise Roe investigates why women in the United Kingdom have plastic surgery on their breasts not just once, but multiple times.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241016085000 +0000" stop="20241016095400 +0000"><title>The Perfect Vagina</title><desc>Lisa Rogers tries to find out why more and more women are considering vaginal surgery for either aesthetic or cultural reasons.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241016095400 +0000" stop="20241016105400 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers on Holiday</title><desc>At the parlour in the sun Sketch meets Peter who’s shocking tattoo is double trouble.
