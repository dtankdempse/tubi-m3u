How much is acceptable among three contestants in each episode is determined by the "dater," who hears the candidates' intimate secrets and hidden flaws, as well as their attempts to deflect these traits by describing their positive attributes. After two elimination rounds leave one remaining contestant, it's the dater's turn to reveal his or her own baggage ... and then the contestant decides to go forward with the date or not.

His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce".

Twenty-eight-year-old owner and head chef Alex offers modern Italian cuisine, a taste of Little Italy in England's first garden city, and the restaurant is run by his best mate maitre dé Gavin, helped by his ex-air hostess girlfriend Emily. But Alex has no customers, cookers that don't work and an expensive menu that's about as authentically Italian as a spag bol.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241201024400 +0000" stop="20241201034700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's second programme is D-Place in Chelmsford, Essex run by Mexican-born Israel and his English partner Tara. They've sunk ~£150,000 of their own money into their trendy café bar which offers a vast selection of fusion cuisine. In charge is Executive Chef Philippe, producing everything from all-day breakfasts to hoi sin noodles with an astounding lack of flair; the plastic food is dire and boomerangs back from the dining room as soon as it's cooked.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241201034700 +0000" stop="20241201045100 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's third programme is Momma Cherri's Soul Food Shack, an intimate forty-seater a stone's throw from Brighton's sea front.

Loic is on a mission, to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of haggis, tatties and deep-fried Mars bars. But though he's hungry for success, he's French, he's arrogant and the food's pretentious.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241201055300 +0000" stop="20241201064500 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Applegate, Oregon, to try to rescue the failing Applegate River Lodge.
