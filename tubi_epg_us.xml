On the surface this place seems idyllic, an Irish family run restaurant in the heart of beautiful countryside. Owner MAURA runs the front of house and her son LENIN is the Head chef, but it's not "happy families". With her life savings on the line Maura is in big trouble. She constantly bickers with her son whilst the customers are forced to wait hours for their fluorescent crab stick paellas, and stodgy carbonaras from Oscars "bit of everything" menu.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241021060000 +0000" stop="20241021070000 +0000"><title>Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Cookery Course</title><desc>S01:E07 - Slow Cooking</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241021070000 +0000" stop="20241021080000 +0000"><title>Gordon Ramsay's Ultimate Cookery Course</title><desc>S01:E08 - Brunches</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241021080000 +0000" stop="20241021090000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's program Gordon Ramsay travels to the seaside to help ailing hotel and restaurant, The Sandgate.

La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241021100000 +0000" stop="20241021110000 +0000"><title>MasterChef</title><desc>The Top 14 receive a mystery box challenge inspired by the White House garden from former First Lady Michelle Obama.

For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241021213000 +0000" stop="20241021223200 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's penultimate programme is The Curry Lounge in Nottingham, the city with more restaurants per square mile than any other in Britain.

Despite a ~500k refurbishment and décor like a Bollywood set the honeymoon period's well and truly over. His once-healthy trade is evaporating and at his current rate of loss it's uncertain he'll make it past Christmas.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241021223200 +0000" stop="20241021233400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is Ruby Tates in Brighton, owned and run by ex-actor and failed Hollywood wannabe ALLAN LOVE.
