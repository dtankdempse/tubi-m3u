On this adventure, Mark is toting his Gunwerks BlastR handgun as he hunts the swamps with his sights set on a big mature gator. Alligators are typically judged in the field by looking at the distance from their eyes to the tip of their nose. The rule of thumb is that they grow a foot in length every year until they are eight years old, then grown an inch per year after that. At 13 feet 3 inches, this old gator is one for the books.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241009081114 +0000" stop="20241009083024 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Mark Peterson is south of the border in Veracruz, Mexico chasing the Mexican Gulf Coast Whitetail.
