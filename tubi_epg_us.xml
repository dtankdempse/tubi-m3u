Second only to Alaska in size, Texas is known as the place where everything is bigger. From big college football games to endless oil fields and vast wind farms, Texas is home to more than 30 million Americans. But the state is about more than just big oil, college football and cattle farms - it's also home to some of the best boating in the country. Boasting a myriad of waterways, boaters here enjoy hundreds of lakes, rivers and streams that provide recreational opportunities, abundant wildlife and plenty of fishing. From Austin Texas to San Antonio host Ryan McVinney and the Boat Trader crew explore the laid-back Texas lake life including boat up restaurants along the Colorado River, watersports in Austin and the history of the waterways throughout the region. Boat manufacturers highlighted in this episode are Tige Boats and ATX Surf Boats, two premium Texas-based wake boat brands known for their high-quality, cutting-edge vessels that come equipped with advanced wake shaping technologies and equipment ideal for water skiing, wake surfing and wakeboarding. There's even a wake surfing dog!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241128000037 +0000" stop="20241128003029 +0000"><title>Primos</title><desc>Team Primos chases whitetail deer at our home camp, Kudzu Bluff, on the edge of the MS Delta.

Second only to Alaska in size, Texas is known as the place where everything is bigger. From big college football games to endless oil fields and vast wind farms, Texas is home to more than 30 million Americans. But the state is about more than just big oil, college football and cattle farms - it's also home to some of the best boating in the country. Boasting a myriad of waterways, boaters here enjoy hundreds of lakes, rivers and streams that provide recreational opportunities, abundant wildlife and plenty of fishing. From Austin Texas to San Antonio host Ryan McVinney and the Boat Trader crew explore the laid-back Texas lake life including boat up restaurants along the Colorado River, watersports in Austin and the history of the waterways throughout the region. Boat manufacturers highlighted in this episode are Tige Boats and ATX Surf Boats, two premium Texas-based wake boat brands known for their high-quality, cutting-edge vessels that come equipped with advanced wake shaping technologies and equipment ideal for water skiing, wake surfing and wakeboarding. There's even a wake surfing dog!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241128000037 +0000" stop="20241128003029 +0000"><title>Primos</title><desc>Team Primos chases whitetail deer at our home camp, Kudzu Bluff, on the edge of the MS Delta.

The former chapel of a nineteenth-century convent, the restaurant is in a spectacularly beautiful location and offers bargain roast dinners from a carvery that's been running for twenty years. Scott bought the place for £300k but with an ageing clientele eating for half-price, he's losing £5,000 a week.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241127205000 +0000" stop="20241127214800 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage are tasked with refloating a pre-World War II boat, but on the way to the site, team leader Luke receives an emergency SOS about another mission.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241127214800 +0000" stop="20241127224700 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage are tasked with refloating a pre-World War II boat, but on the way to the site, team leader Luke receives an emergency SOS about another mission.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241127224700 +0000" stop="20241127234000 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay checks in to the Juniper Hill Inn in Windsor, VT, a place that looks like a million dollars but smells of raw sewage.

La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128023100 +0000" stop="20241128033400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire. The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128033400 +0000" stop="20241128043500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128043500 +0000" stop="20241128053800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128053800 +0000" stop="20241128063900 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Sketch invalidates Kieran's raunchy request; Alice spices up superfan Hugo's life; Pash covers Shelly's preposterous poem; Uzzi reins in Craig's horrible horse; Harry's vegan tattoo gets revamped.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128063900 +0000" stop="20241128073800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers on Holiday</title><desc>Ian needs help to cover his Magaluf monstrosity and Jay gives Callum a portrait to remember.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128073800 +0000" stop="20241128083800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers on Holiday</title><desc>Jay is taking on best mates Sam and Laura's cheeky stickmen, Sketch is helping out Aaron with a lads holiday regret and spontaneous Danny's Magaluf mistake is Wrecked'tified.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128083800 +0000" stop="20241128094100 +0000"><title>The Kinky Sex Survey</title><desc>Ordinary people from across the U.K. reveal their favorite fetishes, kinks and unusual sexual practices; experts explain where unusual sexual desires come from and why there's no such thing as normal.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128094100 +0000" stop="20241128104000 +0000"><title>Love Me, Love My Doll</title><desc>Men who have been unable to form relationships with real women choose custom-made, life-sized dolls to serve as their romantic partners.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128104000 +0000" stop="20241128113800 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>Marie ended up being rushed into hospital when surgery to remove excess skin left her with life threatening sepsis.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128113800 +0000" stop="20241128123500 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>Sue's 'cut price' tummy tuck in Turkey almost killed her and Oli's quest to become a Korean pop star led him to spend £100,000 to look like his Asian idols.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128123500 +0000" stop="20241128125800 +0000"><title>Program information currently unavailable.</title></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128125800 +0000" stop="20241128135000 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Coeur D’Alene, Idaho, to try to rescue the failing Roosevelt Inn.
