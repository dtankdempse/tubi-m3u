Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241113014400 +0000" stop="20241113025000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Nick and Richard are self-confessed restaurant virgins.  They've both had successful careers in the brewery business so when they bought Moore Place they believed they could make it an instant success.  What they hadn't realized was just how difficult it would be to fill the 90-seater oak-paneled restaurant and how hard it would be to find a chef who could cook decent food.

Has Ramsay's fast-track guide to restaurant success helped these brewery whiz-kids transform their failing ex-Berni Inn into a profitable business? And is the building still painted that disgusting shade of purple?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241113025000 +0000" stop="20241113035400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The episode that has gone down in TV history. Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in "fine dining", he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241113035400 +0000" stop="20241113044800 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Harper’s Ferry in West Virginia, to try to save a historic hotel that’s desperately in need of help.
