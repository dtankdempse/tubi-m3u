The detectives are baffled as to a motive for murder - until they consider that the newly engaged Dr James Kirkwood may have been the intended victim. Before long, Barnaby and Jones are heading to Wales - former home to Delyth Mostyn, James's fiancee, to delve deeper into the mystery. There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241224212900 +0000" stop="20241224231600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village. The dispute seems harmless enough - until Lionel Bell is found murdered in a nearby woodland, strangled with the cord of his light meter. Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation. Barnaby is forced to work off the case to uncover who is framing him, and who wants dead other photographers in the village.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241224231600 +0000" stop="20241225011800 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When DCI Barnaby and DS Troy arrive in the sleepy village of Badger's Drift to investigate the sudden death of elderly Miss Emily Simpson, her next door neighbour insists that she had been murdered, after she had seen her return from a walk in the woods, unnerved and shocked by something she had witnessed. When the post mortem confirms her death was no accident, the pair discover that nothing is what it seems to be within the little village as they try to find out what exactly she saw. Their investigation introduces Barnaby and Troy to many eccentric and quirky residents and soon turns up a web of sex, blackmail and lies, and the possibility that the murder could be connected to a shooting accident two years ago, which claimed another woman's life.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241225011800 +0000" stop="20241225030500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The residents of Midsomer Magna are thrilled when a production crew arrives at the local manor house to film a version of The Scarlet Pimpernel. But the crew members aren't the only visitors to the area - Jones has spotted notorious criminal George Ince nearby. But when the director, Nick Cheney, is found dead - his head severed by a prop guillotine - Barnaby must discover who would have wanted the victim dead. It soon becomes clear that things are not so simple, and the detectives soon have to shift through varying motives, layered by lies, hidden truths, and a possible robbery to be committed.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241225030500 +0000" stop="20241225045200 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby is in Midsomer Holm, bidding farewell to reformed criminal Ronnie Tyler, who has taken part in a rehabilitation scheme in the village. Also present is disgraced ex-policeman Jack Colby, a former colleague of Barnaby's – but Jack refuses to talk to his old friend. When Jack is murdered, the detective must delve into the dark secrets in the victim's past. There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death. It isn't long before he finds that Eddie Marston is attempting blackmail, and soon murdered as a result, and that Lord Holm is in love with Jack's wife, psychotherapist Gina.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241225045200 +0000" stop="20241225063800 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The appearance of a headless horseman at Quitewell Hall foreshadows a number of deaths amongst an aristocratic family.

The former chapel of a nineteenth-century convent, the restaurant is in a spectacularly beautiful location and offers bargain roast dinners from a carvery that's been running for twenty years.

Despite a ~500k refurbishment and décor like a Bollywood set the honeymoon period's well and truly over. His once-healthy trade is evaporating and at his current rate of loss it's uncertain he'll make it past Christmas.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241224231000 +0000" stop="20241225001300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's final programme is The Granary in rural Hampshire, an upmarket restaurant which - at 200 seats - is the biggest Gordon's ever taken on. Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241225001300 +0000" stop="20241225011300 +0000"><title>Hoarders SOS (Season 1)</title><desc>Can a Cambridgeshire woman be persuaded to part with her piles of perfume bottles and clothes?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241225011300 +0000" stop="20241225021400 +0000"><title>Hoarders SOS (Season 1)</title><desc>Collectibles expert Curtis Dowling and queens of clean Joanna Riley and Marianne Cammack help two households de-clutter their homes and make some cash.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241225021400 +0000" stop="20241225031400 +0000"><title>Hoarders SOS (Season 1)</title><desc>Two friends who have house shared for seven years in Lancashire make a Hoarder SOS call to help them rid their home of an eclectic mix of clutter, from fantasy board games to a valuable vintage leather jacket.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241225031400 +0000" stop="20241225040800 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay checks in to The Monticello Hotel in Longview, Washington, owned by Phillip Lovingfoss: a wealthy individual with a fleet of classic cars and a drinking problem so serious that it is threatening to destroy his hotel and his life.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241225040800 +0000" stop="20241225050200 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Applegate, Oregon, to try to rescue the failing Applegate River Lodge.
