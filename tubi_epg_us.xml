It is happening everywhere and there is a SHARK EXPLOSION.This is a highly controversial topic because most of the population have been conditioned to believe that Sharks populations are on the decline and somehow they are rare, delicate and almost on the endangered species list.NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM THE TRUTH IN FLORIDA. Shark numbers are higher than any professional guides have ever seen in their careers. They are everywhere and they are attacking anglers catches on record levels inshore, offshore and everywhere in between.On today's episode we have Congressman Rob Wittman. The Congressman is an avid outdoorsman and fan of Saltwater Experience. He loves to fish and enjoy the beautiful fisheries our country has to offer. He has also seen the dramatic rise in shark populations and has decided to do something about it.Congressman Rob Whittman came on the show to explain the new legislation he is co-sponsoring to try to help curb the Shark Depredation that is affecting fisherman all up and down our coasts.Follow the Congressman on YouTube: @RobWittmanFollow the Congressman on Instagram: @reprobwittmanLearn more about the legislation: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://wittman.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID%3D5074&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1691708517016000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0HAqYBdOO717jCLeeHBlgRVideo Credits: https://www.instagram.com/kaitmariedesigns/ and Dillon Mayhttps://www.instagram.com/robchapmanfishing/https://www.instagram.com/fuck.the.taxman/https://www.instagram.com/ryanherbach/https://www.instagram.com/salty_henry/https://www.instagram.com/smelsdaddy34/https://www.instagram.com/finplannersportfishing/https://www.instagram.com/delphfishing/</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241107045132 +0000" stop="20241107050020 +0000"><title>AFTCO Original Film</title><desc>Set in Wisconsin, “Up North” explores the passion and pursuit of the midwestern angler. Whether they’re breaking ice on Green Bay to chase trophy walleye or traveling up to the Northwoods to carry on years of family traditions, Kaitlin and Josh Woodward embody a passion for fishing in its truest form. After fishing together for nearly 11 years, the Woodwards started a part-time guiding business in 2019 called Woodward Fishing to share their passion for their own Wisconsin waters. Some of Kaitlin’s favorite memories on the water have been in Green Bay chasing trophy fish; she recounts, “Every cast was a pre-spawn 25” -27” walleye; it was unreal.” Their teamwork and drive on the water are unmatched. Josh brings his determination to find the fish, and Kaitlin brings her tenacity and ability to get everyone back to the purity of nature no matter what the day brings.They have guided together for the past four years in the Northwoods of Wisconsin and Green Bay, and both areas hold an equally special place for the Woodwards. Josh cut his teeth fishing in Green Bay and Sturgeon Bay with his grandfather and grew up going to the Northwoods with his family. These traditions have become a way of life for Josh and Kaitlin as their year revolves around making the most of the season in both locations with their favorite boat dog, Kimber, in tow. “My family was here before my time, and now we’re going to pass that on to our kids.” – Josh WoodwardFollow their adventures as they put AFTCO fishing rain gear to the test in our newest AFTCO Original Film, “Up North.”</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241107050020 +0000" stop="20241107053014 +0000"><title>Captain's Log</title><desc>Captain Jonathan Moss is fishing the South Carolina low country with Captain Stephen Flook Jr.  The weather is cold and windy, but the plan remains the same, FULL SEND!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241107053014 +0000" stop="20241107060006 +0000"><title>Captain's Log</title><desc>Captain Jonathan Moss is in Columbia, South Carolina, fishing with Captain Justin McGrady for the elusive freshwater Striped Bass.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241107060006 +0000" stop="20241107063004 +0000"><title>Captain's Log</title><desc>Captains Jonathan Moss and Josh Greer are fishing for south Florida’s exotics amongst the alligators of the Florida Everglades.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241107063004 +0000" stop="20241107070005 +0000"><title>Captain's Log</title><desc>Captain Jonathan Moss shares the skiff with the creator of D.O.A.

It is happening everywhere and there is a SHARK EXPLOSION.This is a highly controversial topic because most of the population have been conditioned to believe that Sharks populations are on the decline and somehow they are rare, delicate and almost on the endangered species list.NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM THE TRUTH IN FLORIDA. Shark numbers are higher than any professional guides have ever seen in their careers. They are everywhere and they are attacking anglers catches on record levels inshore, offshore and everywhere in between.On today's episode we have Congressman Rob Wittman. The Congressman is an avid outdoorsman and fan of Saltwater Experience. He loves to fish and enjoy the beautiful fisheries our country has to offer. He has also seen the dramatic rise in shark populations and has decided to do something about it.Congressman Rob Whittman came on the show to explain the new legislation he is co-sponsoring to try to help curb the Shark Depredation that is affecting fisherman all up and down our coasts.Follow the Congressman on YouTube: @RobWittmanFollow the Congressman on Instagram: @reprobwittmanLearn more about the legislation: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://wittman.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID%3D5074&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1691708517016000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0HAqYBdOO717jCLeeHBlgRVideo Credits: https://www.instagram.com/kaitmariedesigns/ and Dillon Mayhttps://www.instagram.com/robchapmanfishing/https://www.instagram.com/fuck.the.taxman/https://www.instagram.com/ryanherbach/https://www.instagram.com/salty_henry/https://www.instagram.com/smelsdaddy34/https://www.instagram.com/finplannersportfishing/https://www.instagram.com/delphfishing/</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241107045132 +0000" stop="20241107050020 +0000"><title>AFTCO Original Film</title><desc>Set in Wisconsin, “Up North” explores the passion and pursuit of the midwestern angler. Whether they’re breaking ice on Green Bay to chase trophy walleye or traveling up to the Northwoods to carry on years of family traditions, Kaitlin and Josh Woodward embody a passion for fishing in its truest form. After fishing together for nearly 11 years, the Woodwards started a part-time guiding business in 2019 called Woodward Fishing to share their passion for their own Wisconsin waters. Some of Kaitlin’s favorite memories on the water have been in Green Bay chasing trophy fish; she recounts, “Every cast was a pre-spawn 25” -27” walleye; it was unreal.” Their teamwork and drive on the water are unmatched. Josh brings his determination to find the fish, and Kaitlin brings her tenacity and ability to get everyone back to the purity of nature no matter what the day brings.They have guided together for the past four years in the Northwoods of Wisconsin and Green Bay, and both areas hold an equally special place for the Woodwards. Josh cut his teeth fishing in Green Bay and Sturgeon Bay with his grandfather and grew up going to the Northwoods with his family. These traditions have become a way of life for Josh and Kaitlin as their year revolves around making the most of the season in both locations with their favorite boat dog, Kimber, in tow. “My family was here before my time, and now we’re going to pass that on to our kids.” – Josh WoodwardFollow their adventures as they put AFTCO fishing rain gear to the test in our newest AFTCO Original Film, “Up North.”</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241107050020 +0000" stop="20241107053014 +0000"><title>Captain's Log</title><desc>Captain Jonathan Moss is fishing the South Carolina low country with Captain Stephen Flook Jr.  The weather is cold and windy, but the plan remains the same, FULL SEND!</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241107053014 +0000" stop="20241107060006 +0000"><title>Captain's Log</title><desc>Captain Jonathan Moss is in Columbia, South Carolina, fishing with Captain Justin McGrady for the elusive freshwater Striped Bass.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241107060006 +0000" stop="20241107063004 +0000"><title>Captain's Log</title><desc>Captains Jonathan Moss and Josh Greer are fishing for south Florida’s exotics amongst the alligators of the Florida Everglades.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241107063004 +0000" stop="20241107070005 +0000"><title>Captain's Log</title><desc>Captain Jonathan Moss shares the skiff with the creator of D.O.A.

The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106024900 +0000" stop="20241106035100 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point. The restaurant is on its last legs - they've run out of customers, money and hope. Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106035100 +0000" stop="20241106044400 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay visits a “Caribbean” style resort hotel in Fort Pierce, Florida where the young inexperienced owner, Brian is making guests’ time at the hotel miserable with filthy rooms, late night concerts and shocking service.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106044400 +0000" stop="20241106053800 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Island Park, Idaho to try and rescue the failing Angler’s Lodge.

But though he's hungry for success, he's French, he's arrogant and the food's pretentious.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106205000 +0000" stop="20241106215300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's program is Clubway 41, despite being voted Blackpool Tourist Board Restaurant of the year, the place is dire straits. It is the prime example of HOW NOT TO RUN A RESTAURANT. Owner DAVE is the flakey self-appointed head chef, who hasn't been in a kitchen for 30 years and can't cook. His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce". Gordon faces a hellish week, Clubway 41 is breaking every rule in book, can he bring Dave, Dawn and their food back to earth?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106215300 +0000" stop="20241106224700 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage has been commissioned to remove a giant floating pontoon that won't float but they keep running into trouble.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106224700 +0000" stop="20241106234100 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Team Salvage has been tasked with back-to-back rescue missions, an underwater pipeline job and a concrete houseboat recovery from deep within the mangroves.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106234100 +0000" stop="20241107003900 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>Family disputes lead to a sexual-abuse case.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241107003900 +0000" stop="20241107013700 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>Family disputes lead to a sexual-abuse case.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241107013700 +0000" stop="20241107023600 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>Family disputes lead to a sexual-abuse case.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241107023600 +0000" stop="20241107033800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's second programme is Piccolo Teatro, a bijou vegetarian restaurant in Paris run by feisty Scot Rachel. A former waitress at the restaurant, Rachel bought it three years ago and now, along with best friend Stephanie, she's trying to convert the carnivorous French into a nation of veggies. For Gordon it's a sentimental journey to the city where he spent his formative years as a chef, a food mecca full of gastronomic delights that should be a dream.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241107033800 +0000" stop="20241107044000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's penultimate programme is The Curry Lounge in Nottingham, the city with more restaurants per square mile than any other in Britain. This 120-seater Indian restaurant has been run since January by ex sales director Raz who's new to the business - and it shows. Despite a ~500k refurbishment and décor like a Bollywood set the honeymoon period's well and truly over. His once-healthy trade is evaporating and at his current rate of loss it's uncertain he'll make it past Christmas.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241107044000 +0000" stop="20241107054300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's final programme is The Granary in rural Hampshire, an upmarket restaurant which - at 200 seats - is the biggest Gordon's ever taken on. Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241107054300 +0000" stop="20241107064500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241107064500 +0000" stop="20241107074700 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space;
