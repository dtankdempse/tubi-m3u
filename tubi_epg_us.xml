The company is thinking about increasing Tom's exposure by producing a new television show around him. Liz Madison is the advice columnist for the little read community newspaper, the Marin County Voice, which is a throwback to gentler times. Besides their journalistic occupations, one other similar aspect between Tom and Liz is that they are both currently single, with their friends and family doing whatever they can to find that special someone for their personal life. On November 2, the staff at the Voice learn that the Sun ownership has bought their newspaper, with the probable goal of folding it into the operations of the Sun. If this move does happen, the staff at the Voice will lose their jobs. To fight back, Liz decides to change her column to an editorial espousing the meaning of Christmas and the newspaper to the community.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241219033058 +0000" stop="20241219052003 +0000"><title>A Vineyard Christmas</title><desc>TV host Heather tries to make the perfect Christmas episode but clashes with the winery owner.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241219052003 +0000" stop="20241219070521 +0000"><title>Christmas Cupid's Arrow</title><desc>Holly, a single college professor, signs up for an online dating service, but begins to grow suspicious when the guy's beautifully-written texts don't match his actions.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241219070521 +0000" stop="20241219085523 +0000"><title>Candid About Love</title><desc>Laura must get reclusive artist Shane to premiere his work at a gallery to help her own career.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241219085523 +0000" stop="20241219104029 +0000"><title>The Love Hunt</title><desc>A real estate exec and a farmer team up to find hidden treasure and love.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241219104029 +0000" stop="20241219110927 +0000"><title>New Dogs, Old Tricks</title><desc>It's the day of the Gamma Fair, but Sarah doesn't want to go.

During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large. The detectives soon have to delve into a world of rock music, drug use and greed, to find the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241220005700 +0000" stop="20241220025600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby and Troy tackle two separate cases as Troy prepares to leave Midsomer after his promotion to DI.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241220025600 +0000" stop="20241220045400 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby's new Sergeant arrives on the day after the murder of a local shrew occurs, and he is immediately put to work.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241220045400 +0000" stop="20241220064900 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Long-suppressed family secrets, stolen ancient artefacts, and a thirty year old death at a Celtic burial site result in a series of murders in present day Midsomer.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241220064900 +0000" stop="20241220084400 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When Midsomer hosts its 12th Annual Literary Festival, an author is found with his neck broken.

Shortly before leaving their hotel they mention they haven't been able to find what they're looking for; "something old and derelict that they can do up." Anne Merrick tells them about Winyard, a tumbledown cottage in the woods, might be for sale. At the estate agents they are told the house is not yet available for viewing. Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter. The next morning they are found strangled in their own car. DCI Barnaby starts the investigation with the help of PC Ben Jones and they come across the world of estate agents, identical twins, ghosts, piano wire, and more before another body turns up.</desc></programme><channel id="671073"><display-name>Unsolved Mysteries</display-name><icon src="https://canvas-lb.tubitv.com/opts/Qx5hBhnp1aNAZg==/864892f9-3ab0-4950-9f8b-189ec2d92c20/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjJAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="671073" start="20241219012100 +0000" stop="20241219021700 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>Jesse James Hollywood and update; Rider Down and update; Bad Dad; Picture Kristen Gone.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241219021700 +0000" stop="20241219031400 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Fatima (Partes 1, 2 &amp; 3), Fraude de Cabaña &amp; Actualización, Actualización: Si la Verdad se Supiera y Mejilla Faltante</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241219031400 +0000" stop="20241219041300 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: SADD Fugitive, Nazca Lines, Where's Charoltte? and The Enetity The.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241219041300 +0000" stop="20241219051000 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Missing Rock Star &amp; UD, UD: Wandering Fishman, St. Louis Custody Killing &amp; UD, Animal Therapist, Who Do Voodoo? and Molnar Heir &amp; UD.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241219051000 +0000" stop="20241219060800 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>Massachusetts marine; update: taunting bank robber; Packer church fire; Ms. Miracle; train wreck amnesia and update.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241219060800 +0000" stop="20241219070300 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Battling for Her Brother &amp; UD, UD: Johnny Lee Wilson, Kempton's Search &amp; UD, Missing Bonnie &amp; UD and Devil's Backbone.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241219070300 +0000" stop="20241219075900 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>Socorro close encounter, update: car crash thank you; Kentucky visions; foster twins and update; elevator murder.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241219075900 +0000" stop="20241219085900 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Comedy Store Ghosts, New Year's Samaritan &amp; UD, UD: Fritz &amp; the Soldiers, NY Serial Rapist &amp; UD and Suspicious Suicide.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241219085900 +0000" stop="20241219095600 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Asesinato 101, ¿Quién Salvó Mi Vida? &amp; Actualización, El Asesino de Venganzas y Muerte &amp; Desaparición.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241219095600 +0000" stop="20241219105300 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>Jesse James Hollywood and update; Rider Down and update; Bad Dad; Picture Kristen Gone.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241219105300 +0000" stop="20241219114900 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: El Fugitivo Tira Bombas (Partes 1 &amp; 2) &amp; Actualización, Actualización: Asesino del Seguro Social, Mona Lisa, ¿Está Muerta Doreen?

The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241219035900 +0000" stop="20241219050100 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point. The restaurant is on its last legs - they've run out of customers, money and hope. Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241219050100 +0000" stop="20241219060200 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>When 21 year old chef Tim sold "fine dining" to Bonapartes bistro, they assumed he could cook.
