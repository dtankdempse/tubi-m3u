Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

The rule of thumb is that they grow a foot in length every year until they are eight years old, then grown an inch per year after that.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227050700 +0000" stop="20241227060900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point.

Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227060900 +0000" stop="20241227071300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Saturday night at The Glass House Restaurant in Ambleside was a disaster.  Orders in the kitchen were mixed up, the food wasn't cooked properly and the customers were complaining.  Not only was the chef in tears, but the owners were on the brink of bankruptcy.   

A few months on, there have been some departures from the Glass House. Who is in charge of the kitchen now? And, more importantly, is Ramsay's Caesar salad still on the menu?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227071300 +0000" stop="20241227081500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Walnut Tree Inn was in big trouble - there was no head chef, the customers had dwindled, and the owner had been forced to sell the family home to keep the business afloat.
Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227081500 +0000" stop="20241227091200 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>The show uncovers the secrets behind dermal lip fillers and investigates how social media and celebs have driven a boom in the industry.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227091200 +0000" stop="20241227100900 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>When dreams turn into plastic surgery nightmares.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227100900 +0000" stop="20241227110600 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>This episode looks at the dangerous obsession with surgery that often goes hand in hand with a rise to fame.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227110600 +0000" stop="20241227120300 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>Marie ended up being rushed into hospital when surgery to remove excess skin left her with life threatening sepsis.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227120300 +0000" stop="20241227130000 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>Both choppers are called to a head-on road smash in the Yorkshire Dales that’s left two pensioners trapped in their wrecked car.
