He manages the legendary Coca-Cola Woods property in McCrory, Arkansas, has his own line of Echo Duck calls and has placed in the World’s Championship Duck Calling Contest time and again. Further, his skills and expertise have been showcased on many duck hunting shows and podcasts. Yet despite his success as a professional duck hunter, Creasey says managing the Coca-Cola Woods is what he loves most. Known for offering some of the best green timber duck hunting in the Mid-South, the Coca-Cola property was originally bought by the family who owned the Coca-Cola bottling company and turned into a duck club in 1937. Creasey stresses the importance of thanking folks who’ve had a positive impact in your life. “Whoever took you and got you started in the outdoors, if they are still around, thank them,” he says. “Thank them while you still can. My uncle got sick with cancer. I told my mama I want to thank him for everything he did. Little league games. Fishing. And I had that opportunity. I wrote him a birthday card and told him how much he meant to me. He told me that was the best birthday present he ever got. A month later, he lost his battle with cancer, but I had that closure and was able to thank him.” He says since 2002, he’s made a point to thank everyone who has meant anything to him. “My daddy,” he says. “Lost him in 2018. Last thing I told him was I loved him. Thanked him. He was my hero. If I leave you with anything, do this for me. Thank whoever it is. Be it your mama, your daddy, your uncle or your grandpa. Hug their neck, and thank them for all they’ve done for you. Without them planting that seed in us, we wouldn’t be who we are today.”</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241129014959 +0000" stop="20241129023134 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>Anyone can be a cowboy—that’s the biggest thing the DIRT crew learned in Texas.

A year has passed since Mark conquered the North America Waterfowl Slam. During the off-season, and with Covid just a memory, his focus shifted to thoughts of South America and the waterfowl species that it holds. After a few months of research and talking with the experts at Worldwide Trophy Adventures, he laid out the plan to attempt the South America slam in 2022. With 20 species on the list, Mark is now hunting ducks below the equator as they migrate North to warmer weather. Enjoy this first installment of a 9 episode series that showcases his new quest for another single-season waterfowl slam.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241129052959 +0000" stop="20241129055959 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Mark Peterson closes out the half way point on the South America Waterfowl Slam.

He manages the legendary Coca-Cola Woods property in McCrory, Arkansas, has his own line of Echo Duck calls and has placed in the World’s Championship Duck Calling Contest time and again. Further, his skills and expertise have been showcased on many duck hunting shows and podcasts. Yet despite his success as a professional duck hunter, Creasey says managing the Coca-Cola Woods is what he loves most. Known for offering some of the best green timber duck hunting in the Mid-South, the Coca-Cola property was originally bought by the family who owned the Coca-Cola bottling company and turned into a duck club in 1937. Creasey stresses the importance of thanking folks who’ve had a positive impact in your life. “Whoever took you and got you started in the outdoors, if they are still around, thank them,” he says. “Thank them while you still can. My uncle got sick with cancer. I told my mama I want to thank him for everything he did. Little league games. Fishing. And I had that opportunity. I wrote him a birthday card and told him how much he meant to me. He told me that was the best birthday present he ever got. A month later, he lost his battle with cancer, but I had that closure and was able to thank him.” He says since 2002, he’s made a point to thank everyone who has meant anything to him. “My daddy,” he says. “Lost him in 2018. Last thing I told him was I loved him. Thanked him. He was my hero. If I leave you with anything, do this for me. Thank whoever it is. Be it your mama, your daddy, your uncle or your grandpa. Hug their neck, and thank them for all they’ve done for you. Without them planting that seed in us, we wouldn’t be who we are today.”</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241129014959 +0000" stop="20241129023134 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>Anyone can be a cowboy—that’s the biggest thing the DIRT crew learned in Texas.

With 20 species on the list, Mark is now hunting ducks below the equator as they migrate North to warmer weather.
