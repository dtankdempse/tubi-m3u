First up is Mayfair, with a prime location on the busy seafront in Fuengirola, Costa del Sol. The restaurant was set up 28 years ago by 68 year old Londoner Pat and her husband of 45 years, Jack. The good news is that Fuengirola is one of the only towns in Spain that has actually seen an increase in tourists since the recession with 1 and half million Brits visiting last year alone;  the bad news is that Mayfair isn't benefitting. With thousands of hungry sun seekers right on its doorstep, the restaurant should be raking it in - but the place is totally empty.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241109140000 +0000" stop="20241109150000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>World-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay explores new territory in Ramsay's Costa del Nightmares, a four part series that sees him travel to Europe's holiday hotspots.

British owners Tim and Debbie emigrated to France 28 years ago, where they met as holiday reps.  Since then they've poured blood, sweat and tears into opening  3 ski restaurants in the Alps.  With the arrival of their children, they set up home by the coast to enjoy the summer months together as a family.  But unable to sit still, Tim launched Le Deck three years ago.

Nestled inside a small nook of Playa Herradura, Costa Rica’s Los Sueños Resort and Marina serves as a luxury embarkation point for some of the world’s most heralded bluewater fishing.

For the last 120 years, The Explorers Club has been the exclusive epicenter where legendary explorers come together to share some of the most incredible adventure stories ever told. From Roald Amundsen’s 1911 voyage to the South Pole to Sir Edmund Hillary’s ascent to the summit of Mount Everest to astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s history-changing 1969 expedition to the moon, the halls of this institution have echoed with tales of daring discovery and unparalleled human achievement. That’s why we’re beyond stoked to kick off our Huckberry x The Explorers Club partnership—featuring the Land, Sea, and Space Collection from an exclusive Whiskey Peaks collab and a badass grand prize. Tune in now to watch a tour so exclusive, it’s almost like being inducted into the club itself (minus the secret handshake)."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241110164108 +0000" stop="20241110170010 +0000"><title>Huckberry Homes</title><desc>"On this special edition of Huckberry Homes, we explore Floki Studios.

Their investigation introduces Barnaby and Troy to many eccentric and quirky residents and soon turns up a web of sex, blackmail and lies, and the possibility that the murder could be connected to a shooting accident two years ago, which claimed another woman's life.</desc></programme><channel id="671073"><display-name>Unsolved Mysteries</display-name><icon src="https://canvas.tubitv.com/opts/Qx5hBhnp1aNAZg==/864892f9-3ab0-4950-9f8b-189ec2d92c20/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjJAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="671073" start="20241109011000 +0000" stop="20241109020900 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: El Triángulo de las Bermudas, Madre de Prisión &amp; Actualización, Demonios Ya No Está &amp; Actualización y Tácticas de Miedo.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241109020900 +0000" stop="20241109031000 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: ¿Quién es Tyler? &amp; Actualización, El Mickey de Maloney, El Sudario de Turín y Pistas del Mapa de Carretera &amp; Actualización.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241109031000 +0000" stop="20241109040500 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Mujeriego &amp; Actualización, El Dr. Abusador &amp;, Desaparición Interestatal &amp; Actualización y Millón de Un Minuto.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241109040500 +0000" stop="20241109045700 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Tragedia Adolescente, Jim y Tammi, Asesinato en el Departamento de Estado y Excavaciones de Adams Perdidas.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241109045700 +0000" stop="20241109055600 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Muerte en la Interestatal, Billy el Niño, Actualización: Ex Monje Perdido y Policía Abusador &amp; Actualización.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241109055600 +0000" stop="20241109065300 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Socorro Close Encounter, UD: Car Crash Thank You, Kentucky Visions, Foster Twins &amp; UD and Elevator Murder.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241109065300 +0000" stop="20241109075400 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Oro de Tontos, Actualización: Secuestro de Bebé en Baltimore, Suicidio Homicidio, Corredor de Bebés y Donald Eugene Webb.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241109075400 +0000" stop="20241109085300 +0000"><title>Unsolved Mysteries With Robert Stack</title><desc>This episode includes: Brandon Lee, Missing Anchorwoman, First Love, Second Chance &amp; UD, Killer Castro and Gulf P.O.W.

La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241109081200 +0000" stop="20241109091600 +0000"><title>The Perfect Vagina</title><desc>Lisa Rogers tries to find out why more and more women are considering vaginal surgery for either aesthetic or cultural reasons.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241109091600 +0000" stop="20241109101600 +0000"><title>Love Me, Love My Doll</title><desc>Men who have been unable to form relationships with real women choose custom-made, life-sized dolls to serve as their romantic partners.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241109101600 +0000" stop="20241109111500 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers on Holiday</title><desc>The Fixers holiday hijinks continue, and this week Glen rids Mandy of her rabbits, Jay pulls off the perfect portrait and Alice gets her teeth into Helen’s cupcake.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241109111500 +0000" stop="20241109121500 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers on Holiday</title><desc>Sketch takes on Bex whose stinker of a tat has left her feeling unloved, Alice helps Nikki with a tat that has mistakenly mugged off her husband.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241109121500 +0000" stop="20241109130700 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits West Dover in Vermont, to try to save a dog-friendly hotel that’s desperately in need of help.

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241110124500 +0000" stop="20241110134800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Nick and Richard are self-confessed restaurant virgins.

Has Ramsay's fast-track guide to restaurant success helped these brewery whiz-kids transform their failing ex-Berni Inn into a profitable business?

Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in "fine dining", he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart.
