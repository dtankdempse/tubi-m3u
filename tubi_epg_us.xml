Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

On this adventure, Mark is toting his Gunwerks BlastR handgun as he hunts the swamps with his sights set on a big mature gator. Alligators are typically judged in the field by looking at the distance from their eyes to the tip of their nose. The rule of thumb is that they grow a foot in length every year until they are eight years old, then grown an inch per year after that. At 13 feet 3 inches, this old gator is one for the books.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241226151121 +0000" stop="20241226153010 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Accompany Mark Peterson on his ongoing expedition through California, where he pursues the elusive Tule Elk.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

Tommy's son Lionel and grandson Dave, mayor of Causton and whom Barnaby does not like (owing to dodgy building work by the mayor's company), are thrilled, but the snooty Hammonds are decidedly less pleased. Henry, the patriarch of the Hammond family, is particularly riled by his insalubrious neighbours, and has nurtured a long-running feud with the Hickses. But the evening after a battle re-enactment in the village, Henry is murdered - and Barnaby must delve into the history of the two families to find the killer, discovering a web of fraud, lies, and hidden truths.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241226022100 +0000" stop="20241226040600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The residents of Milton Cross, a feudal estate with a church, farms, houses and acres of land, depend on lord of the manor Edward Milton for their livelihoods.

It soon becomes clear someone took a pair of tailor scissors to do the deed, but who amongst the villagers could have done so, is unclear, and the investigation is complicated, when the pair learn the local Anglican priest, the parish vicar, had received a letter from Sonia. When he himself is killed, the pair believe something in the letter may be key to solving the mystery.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241226040600 +0000" stop="20241226055100 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby is not convinced about Mayor David Hicks' plans to revive an annual trip to Brighton, suspecting his proposal to buy coastal land there, is rather a fraudulent scheme.

In a Georgetown coffee shop, three employees were shot to death. Investigators could find no immediate suspects and no clear motive for the attack. Evidence at the crime scene pointed in many different directions. Was this a hate crime, a robbery gone wrong, or an act of cold-blooded vengeance against one of the victims?</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241226123000 +0000" stop="20241226133300 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In 1980, the FBI began a massive undercover operation, code named Safebet, that was designed to expose the Chicago Mafia's infiltration into the city's surrounding suburbs.

With no experience with this kind of predator, Viennese police turned to the FBI. FBI profilers were able to identify a suspect in the murders.
