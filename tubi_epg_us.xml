La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol.

He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241008122400 +0000" stop="20241008132400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Priory, a 100-seater carvery in Haywards Heath, Sussex owned by ex IT consultant Scott.

Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241008142500 +0000" stop="20241008151900 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Applegate, Oregon, to try to rescue the failing Applegate River Lodge.

El FBI de inmediato entró en el caso. Los agentes reunieron fibras de su habitación y descubrieron, a través del uso de fuentes de luz láser, la huella de una palma en la cama de Polly, previamente invisible al ojo humano. Después de una extensa investigación de dos meses, el FBI arrestó a Richard Allen Davis. La impresión de la palma y las fibras coincidieron y Davis fue condenado por secuestro y asesinato.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241009191200 +0000" stop="20241009201500 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>By April of 1995 in Washington, D.C., two officers had been shot and one had been murdered.
