Owner CHARITA JONES was producing a menu of irresistible unique classics from the Deep South, but at the same facing financial disaster. The punters were missing, and so was her business acumen. But Gordon succeeded in shutting her out of the kitchen, getting the chef back on the boil and putting the soul back into the business.

Today Charita is fully-booked round the clock and bursting out of the Soul Shack to take on the 110-seater Momma Cherri's Big House. But expansion brings a different set of challenges, and she's still struggling to control her staff and manage her success. Has she got what it takes to make the next step up, or will she be forced to rethink her grand plans?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241027050000 +0000" stop="20241027060000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's penultimate programme Gordon returns to La Riviera - now renamed Abstract - a fine dining restaurant in Inverness. Owned by multi-millionaire Barry Larson and costing ~£8000 a week to run, the place boasted top French chef Loic Lefebvre and an impeccably-trained kitchen staff, all of them on a mission to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of the haggis. But the locals weren't biting and the restaurant was empty most nights. Gordon's recipe for survival forced them to tone down their act and demystify the menu to get the punters in. Today the restaurant's return to form has led to plans for expansion. Loic is still there, and now he's been promoted to Executive Chef he will oversee any new ventures. But can he continue to resist a return to French frills, and has he managed to pull off his own personal ambition, a Michelin star?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241027060000 +0000" stop="20241027070000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S05:E02 - Episode 2</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241027070000 +0000" stop="20241027080000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S05:E03 - Episode 3</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241027080000 +0000" stop="20241027090000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Tonight, for the first time ever on Kitchen Nightmares, Gordon takes on a nightmare restaurant abroad. La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241027090000 +0000" stop="20241027100000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire.

This one-of-a-kind home now serves as a gathering place for creatives and surfers alike, nestled between the forest and Oregon coast.On Huckberry Homes, we’ll be tapping into the most inspiring members of the Huckberry community to offer an inside peek into how they’ve crafted the place they call home. We will showcase everything from cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that inspire creativity and high-performing lives.We would like to take a moment to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples who have stewarded the land on which this video was created. This area was the home to the Nestucca peoples and other coastal tribes until the mid-1800s when the population was decimated by diseases from settlers. Those who remained were coerced into a coastal reservation by the US government.

Yet, within this pursuit lies a distinct niche: trophy hunting via swimbait fishing. Unlike traditional baits, swimbaits stand out in their uniqueness within an angler's arsenal. Ranging from six to twelve-plus inches in length and weighing two to sixteen ounces, these baits require a quiver of specialized equipment and a different mindset. The adage "big bait, big fish" is the guiding principle, firmly centered on catching the biggest bass in the lake, armed with the largest baits from your tackle box.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241028035538 +0000" stop="20241028040017 +0000"><title>On Deck</title><desc>Florida businesses like Chris’ rely on water quality and another water crisis would be detrimental.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241028040017 +0000" stop="20241028043011 +0000"><title>Modern Hunter</title><desc>A close-knit group of friends from Wisconsin embarks on an exciting duck hunting adventure.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

Yet, within this pursuit lies a distinct niche: trophy hunting via swimbait fishing. Unlike traditional baits, swimbaits stand out in their uniqueness within an angler's arsenal. Ranging from six to twelve-plus inches in length and weighing two to sixteen ounces, these baits require a quiver of specialized equipment and a different mindset. The adage "big bait, big fish" is the guiding principle, firmly centered on catching the biggest bass in the lake, armed with the largest baits from your tackle box.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241028035538 +0000" stop="20241028040017 +0000"><title>On Deck</title><desc>Florida businesses like Chris’ rely on water quality and another water crisis would be detrimental.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241028040017 +0000" stop="20241028043011 +0000"><title>Modern Hunter</title><desc>A close-knit group of friends from Wisconsin embarks on an exciting duck hunting adventure.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

In charge is Executive Chef Philippe, producing everything from all-day breakfasts to hoi sin noodles with an astounding lack of flair; the plastic food is dire and boomerangs back from the dining room as soon as it's cooked.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241027200500 +0000" stop="20241027205900 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>The crew is towing a damaged yacht to a North Queensland boatyard.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241027205900 +0000" stop="20241027215600 +0000"><title>Extreme Salvage Squad</title><desc>Things aren't looking good for Team Salvage as they run into an issue during a major beach rescue.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241027215600 +0000" stop="20241027225000 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay checks in to The Monticello Hotel in Longview, Washington, owned by Phillip Lovingfoss: a wealthy individual with a fleet of classic cars and a drinking problem so serious that it is threatening to destroy his hotel and his life.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241027225000 +0000" stop="20241027234400 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Applegate, Oregon, to try to rescue the failing Applegate River Lodge.

For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241028013900 +0000" stop="20241028024200 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241028024200 +0000" stop="20241028034300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is Ruby Tates in Brighton, owned and run by ex-actor and failed Hollywood wannabe ALLAN LOVE.
