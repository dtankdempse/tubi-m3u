As a result, Yami Marik becomes angered, and attacks Odion with the Millennium Rod, which weakens Odion even more. Odion doesn't give up, despite Ishizu's protests. As Marik continues his onslaught (which begins to injure Odion), Odion tells Marik's good side that together, they had conquered his evil half before, and that they could do it again. Then, he tells the good Marik that since Yami Marik was created by the good Marik's hatred, he has the power to destroy him.

However, Marik's good half stalls Yami Marik long enough for Yugi to activate his spell card. Yugi's Ragnarok spell succeeds in destroying (and removing to the graveyard) Ra, allowing the good Marik to regain control of his body.

Bakura and Mai are returned from the shadow realm and Marik is reunited with his siblings, who forgive him. Yugi receives the three Egyptian God Cards.

Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes.

This 120-seater Indian restaurant has been run since January by ex sales director Raz who's new to the business - and it shows. Despite a ~500k refurbishment and décor like a Bollywood set the honeymoon period's well and truly over. His once-healthy trade is evaporating and at his current rate of loss it's uncertain he'll make it past Christmas.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250102123200 +0000" stop="20250102133200 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's final programme is The Granary in rural Hampshire, an upmarket restaurant which - at 200 seats - is the biggest Gordon's ever taken on. Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250102133200 +0000" stop="20250102143300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250102143300 +0000" stop="20250102153300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue is The Runaway Girl, a tapas bar-cum-nightclub in Sheffield city centre on the brink of collapse. The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250102153300 +0000" stop="20250102163300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point. The restaurant is on its last legs - they've run out of customers, money and hope. Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250102163300 +0000" stop="20250102173500 +0000"><title>Gordon Ramsay: Shark Bait</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay sets out to investigate the controversial "shark fin soup."</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250102173500 +0000" stop="20250102182900 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay checks in to the luxury Lakeview Hotel in Lake Chelan, Washington.

Orders in the kitchen were mixed up, the food wasn't cooked properly and the customers were complaining.  Not only was the chef in tears, but the owners were on the brink of bankruptcy.   

A few months on, there have been some departures from the Glass House. Who is in charge of the kitchen now? And, more importantly, is Ramsay's Caesar salad still on the menu?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250103072900 +0000" stop="20250103082900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Walnut Tree Inn was in big trouble - there was no head chef, the customers had dwindled, and the owner had been forced to sell the family home to keep the business afloat.
Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250103082900 +0000" stop="20250103093500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Nick and Richard are self-confessed restaurant virgins.  They've both had successful careers in the brewery business so when they bought Moore Place they believed they could make it an instant success.  What they hadn't realized was just how difficult it would be to fill the 90-seater oak-paneled restaurant and how hard it would be to find a chef who could cook decent food.

Has Ramsay's fast-track guide to restaurant success helped these brewery whiz-kids transform their failing ex-Berni Inn into a profitable business? And is the building still painted that disgusting shade of purple?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250103093500 +0000" stop="20250103103900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The episode that has gone down in TV history. Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in "fine dining", he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250103103900 +0000" stop="20250103114300 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay starts his culinary journey in the north of India where he cooks for 400 passengers in an express train's cramped pantry car.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250103114300 +0000" stop="20250103124500 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>Gordon immerses himself in the life of a local tribe in Nagaland, visits Assam to enter a housewives' competition and sets up shop on the streets of Calcutta.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250103124500 +0000" stop="20250103134700 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>Gordon ends his travels to India by heading south, living in an ashram in Kerala and working alongside one of India's top chefs in Mumbai.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250103134700 +0000" stop="20250103143800 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Starkville, Mississippi to try to rescue the failing Hotel Chester.
