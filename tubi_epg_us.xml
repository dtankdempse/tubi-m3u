Yet, within this pursuit lies a distinct niche: trophy hunting via swimbait fishing. Unlike traditional baits, swimbaits stand out in their uniqueness within an angler's arsenal. Ranging from six to twelve-plus inches in length and weighing two to sixteen ounces, these baits require a quiver of specialized equipment and a different mindset. The adage "big bait, big fish" is the guiding principle, firmly centered on catching the biggest bass in the lake, armed with the largest baits from your tackle box.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241125045327 +0000" stop="20241125050014 +0000"><title>AFTCO Original Film</title><desc>Panama is known for its world-class and virtually untouched fisheries.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

It soon becomes clear someone took a pair of tailor scissors to do the deed, but who amongst the villagers could have done so, is unclear, and the investigation is complicated, when the pair learn the local Anglican priest, the parish vicar, had received a letter from Sonia.

A young woman was snatched from her home on a bright spring morning.  Drops of blood and a torn window screen were all that was left to tell authorities what happened to the twenty-one year old victim.
