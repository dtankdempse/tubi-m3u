For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~¬£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241028050000 +0000" stop="20241028060000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241028060000 +0000" stop="20241028070000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S05:E05 - Episode 5</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241028070000 +0000" stop="20241028080000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S05:E06 - Episode 6</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241028080000 +0000" stop="20241028090000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Gordon last left Laurence knowing that he had simplified his menu to have clean, simple, honest, traditional food using local produce.

Yet, within this pursuit lies a distinct niche: trophy hunting via swimbait fishing. Unlike traditional baits, swimbaits stand out in their uniqueness within an angler's arsenal. Ranging from six to twelve-plus inches in length and weighing two to sixteen ounces, these baits require a quiver of specialized equipment and a different mindset. The adage "big bait, big fish" is the guiding principle, firmly centered on catching the biggest bass in the lake, armed with the largest baits from your tackle box.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241028035540 +0000" stop="20241028040019 +0000"><title>On Deck</title><desc>Florida businesses like Chris‚Äô rely on water quality and another water crisis would be detrimental.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241028040019 +0000" stop="20241028043014 +0000"><title>Modern Hunter</title><desc>A close-knit group of friends from Wisconsin embarks on an exciting duck hunting adventure.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It‚Äôs a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won‚Äôt be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he‚Äôs not very picky about the one that gets tied on. ‚ÄúWhen fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn‚Äôt matter because it‚Äôs all about the presentation,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‚Äòjunk jigs‚Äô ‚Äì they get bit just fine.‚Äù And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita.

Yet, within this pursuit lies a distinct niche: trophy hunting via swimbait fishing. Unlike traditional baits, swimbaits stand out in their uniqueness within an angler's arsenal. Ranging from six to twelve-plus inches in length and weighing two to sixteen ounces, these baits require a quiver of specialized equipment and a different mindset. The adage "big bait, big fish" is the guiding principle, firmly centered on catching the biggest bass in the lake, armed with the largest baits from your tackle box.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241028035540 +0000" stop="20241028040019 +0000"><title>On Deck</title><desc>Florida businesses like Chris‚Äô rely on water quality and another water crisis would be detrimental.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241028040019 +0000" stop="20241028043014 +0000"><title>Modern Hunter</title><desc>A close-knit group of friends from Wisconsin embarks on an exciting duck hunting adventure.

Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he‚Äôs not very picky about the one that gets tied on. ‚ÄúWhen fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn‚Äôt matter because it‚Äôs all about the presentation,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‚Äòjunk jigs‚Äô ‚Äì they get bit just fine.‚Äù And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita.

The two detectives soon find their investigations crossing over, when a man found to have an illegal collection of bird eggs, is also murdered, prompting concerns that the millionaire's scheme is being used to defraud many, and that someone is willing to kill to keep the scheme going.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20241029140000 +0000" stop="20241029160000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby and Troy tackle two separate cases as Troy prepares to leave Midsomer after his promotion to DI.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20241029160000 +0000" stop="20241029180000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby's new Sergeant arrives on the day after the murder of a local shrew occurs, and he is immediately put to work.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20241029180000 +0000" stop="20241029190000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>When a bitter custody battle ends with a courthouse murder, the team must use the available evidence to find the killer.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20241029190000 +0000" stop="20241029200000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>When there is a murder at a high-school reunion, the team investigates and learns that popularity issues from the past played a role in the killer's motives.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20241029200000 +0000" stop="20241029210000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>When a condemned ax-murderer on death row appeals for his life, the team must investigate.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20241029210000 +0000" stop="20241029220000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>Horatio finally learns the truth about what happened to his brother, and the repercussions will change his life forever.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20241029220000 +0000" stop="20241029230000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>Horatio finds himself with a price on his head when he makes plans to shut down the illegal smuggling operation of one of Miami's fiercest gangs.</desc></programme><programme channel="684167" start="20241029230000 +0000" stop="20241030000000 +0000"><title>CSI: Miami</title><desc>A rich couple's daughter dies when the family is trapped on a burning yacht in shark-infested waters.</desc></programme><channel id="700415"><display-name>Midsomer Murders</display-name><icon src="https://canvas.tubitv.com/opts/IBJGS19NTeYu4g==/34fa2e5d-6c68-4012-8c19-cc4afe6ad726/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjJAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="700415" start="20241028000700 +0000" stop="20241028015600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby is less than impressed when Sarah drags him to a family friend‚Äôs wedding.

Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes.

Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead.

In addition to strife between members of the family, the factory workers are outraged at the loss of their jobs.

During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large.
