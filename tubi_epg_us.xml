He manages the legendary Coca-Cola Woods property in McCrory, Arkansas, has his own line of Echo Duck calls and has placed in the World’s Championship Duck Calling Contest time and again. Further, his skills and expertise have been showcased on many duck hunting shows and podcasts. Yet despite his success as a professional duck hunter, Creasey says managing the Coca-Cola Woods is what he loves most. Known for offering some of the best green timber duck hunting in the Mid-South, the Coca-Cola property was originally bought by the family who owned the Coca-Cola bottling company and turned into a duck club in 1937. Creasey stresses the importance of thanking folks who’ve had a positive impact in your life. “Whoever took you and got you started in the outdoors, if they are still around, thank them,” he says. “Thank them while you still can. My uncle got sick with cancer. I told my mama I want to thank him for everything he did. Little league games. Fishing. And I had that opportunity. I wrote him a birthday card and told him how much he meant to me. He told me that was the best birthday present he ever got. A month later, he lost his battle with cancer, but I had that closure and was able to thank him.” He says since 2002, he’s made a point to thank everyone who has meant anything to him. “My daddy,” he says. “Lost him in 2018. Last thing I told him was I loved him. Thanked him. He was my hero. If I leave you with anything, do this for me. Thank whoever it is. Be it your mama, your daddy, your uncle or your grandpa. Hug their neck, and thank them for all they’ve done for you. Without them planting that seed in us, we wouldn’t be who we are today.”</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241129014959 +0000" stop="20241129023134 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>Anyone can be a cowboy—that’s the biggest thing the DIRT crew learned in Texas.

He manages the legendary Coca-Cola Woods property in McCrory, Arkansas, has his own line of Echo Duck calls and has placed in the World’s Championship Duck Calling Contest time and again. Further, his skills and expertise have been showcased on many duck hunting shows and podcasts. Yet despite his success as a professional duck hunter, Creasey says managing the Coca-Cola Woods is what he loves most. Known for offering some of the best green timber duck hunting in the Mid-South, the Coca-Cola property was originally bought by the family who owned the Coca-Cola bottling company and turned into a duck club in 1937. Creasey stresses the importance of thanking folks who’ve had a positive impact in your life. “Whoever took you and got you started in the outdoors, if they are still around, thank them,” he says. “Thank them while you still can. My uncle got sick with cancer. I told my mama I want to thank him for everything he did. Little league games. Fishing. And I had that opportunity. I wrote him a birthday card and told him how much he meant to me. He told me that was the best birthday present he ever got. A month later, he lost his battle with cancer, but I had that closure and was able to thank him.” He says since 2002, he’s made a point to thank everyone who has meant anything to him. “My daddy,” he says. “Lost him in 2018. Last thing I told him was I loved him. Thanked him. He was my hero. If I leave you with anything, do this for me. Thank whoever it is. Be it your mama, your daddy, your uncle or your grandpa. Hug their neck, and thank them for all they’ve done for you. Without them planting that seed in us, we wouldn’t be who we are today.”</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241129014959 +0000" stop="20241129023134 +0000"><title>Dirt</title><desc>Anyone can be a cowboy—that’s the biggest thing the DIRT crew learned in Texas.

La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128023100 +0000" stop="20241128033400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire. The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128033400 +0000" stop="20241128043500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128043500 +0000" stop="20241128053800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128053800 +0000" stop="20241128063900 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Sketch invalidates Kieran's raunchy request; Alice spices up superfan Hugo's life; Pash covers Shelly's preposterous poem; Uzzi reins in Craig's horrible horse; Harry's vegan tattoo gets revamped.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128063900 +0000" stop="20241128073800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers on Holiday</title><desc>Ian needs help to cover his Magaluf monstrosity and Jay gives Callum a portrait to remember.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128073800 +0000" stop="20241128083800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers on Holiday</title><desc>Jay is taking on best mates Sam and Laura's cheeky stickmen, Sketch is helping out Aaron with a lads holiday regret and spontaneous Danny's Magaluf mistake is Wrecked'tified.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128083800 +0000" stop="20241128094100 +0000"><title>The Kinky Sex Survey</title><desc>Ordinary people from across the U.K. reveal their favorite fetishes, kinks and unusual sexual practices; experts explain where unusual sexual desires come from and why there's no such thing as normal.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128094100 +0000" stop="20241128104000 +0000"><title>Love Me, Love My Doll</title><desc>Men who have been unable to form relationships with real women choose custom-made, life-sized dolls to serve as their romantic partners.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128104000 +0000" stop="20241128113800 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>Marie ended up being rushed into hospital when surgery to remove excess skin left her with life threatening sepsis.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128113800 +0000" stop="20241128123500 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>Sue's 'cut price' tummy tuck in Turkey almost killed her and Oli's quest to become a Korean pop star led him to spend £100,000 to look like his Asian idols.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128123500 +0000" stop="20241128125800 +0000"><title>Program information currently unavailable.</title></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241128125800 +0000" stop="20241128135000 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Coeur D’Alene, Idaho, to try to rescue the failing Roosevelt Inn.

Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal.
