On this adventure, Mark is toting his Gunwerks BlastR handgun as he hunts the swamps with his sights set on a big mature gator. Alligators are typically judged in the field by looking at the distance from their eyes to the tip of their nose. The rule of thumb is that they grow a foot in length every year until they are eight years old, then grown an inch per year after that. At 13 feet 3 inches, this old gator is one for the books.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241016081148 +0000" stop="20241016083035 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Mark Peterson persists in his pursuit of the North American Deer Slam, setting his sights on Kentucky as his next destination with his focus on the Southeastern Whitetail.

Found in only two counties of Oregon, the Columbia Whitetail is one of the most sought-after deer species. The first day posed its challenges with heavy fog at daybreak, but Mark and his guide Rob kept the pursuit for a big Columbia Whitetail. After putting on many miles throughout the morning, the fog began to lift and they finally laid eyes on their target buck. Moving into position had its challenges with plenty of satellite deer around, but in the end it came together. As an added bonus, Mark’s buck is the new Muzzleloader world record Columbia Whitetail.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241016090030 +0000" stop="20241016092043 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Mark and his dogs travel West to Nebraska to hunt free range Pheasants with his dad Earl.

The former chapel of a nineteenth-century convent, the restaurant is in a spectacularly beautiful location and offers bargain roast dinners from a carvery that's been running for twenty years.

A former waitress at the restaurant, Rachel bought it three years ago and now, along with best friend Stephanie, she's trying to convert the carnivorous French into a nation of veggies. For Gordon it's a sentimental journey to the city where he spent his formative years as a chef, a food mecca full of gastronomic delights that should be a dream.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241015170700 +0000" stop="20241015180900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's penultimate programme is The Curry Lounge in Nottingham, the city with more restaurants per square mile than any other in Britain. This 120-seater Indian restaurant has been run since January by ex sales director Raz who's new to the business - and it shows. Despite a ~500k refurbishment and décor like a Bollywood set the honeymoon period's well and truly over. His once-healthy trade is evaporating and at his current rate of loss it's uncertain he'll make it past Christmas.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241015180900 +0000" stop="20241015191000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers on Holiday</title><desc>The pop up parlour in the sun gets a visit from a noughties heartthrob.

Big soul momma, owner Charita Jones, produces a menu of irresistibly unique classics from the Deep South. The food's hard to fault but the punters are nowhere to be seen, Head Chef Brian and a rag-tag collection of part-timers are taking the mickey - and despite working a seven-day week Charita's got an empty restaurant and a ~£65,000 debt.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241016043400 +0000" stop="20241016053700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's fourth programme is La Riviera, a fine dining restaurant in Inverness. Owned by multi-millionaire Barry Larson and costing ~£8000 a week to run, the place boasts top French chef Loic Lefebvre and an impeccably-trained kitchen staff with Michelin star-studded backgrounds. Loic is on a mission, to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of haggis, tatties and deep-fried Mars bars. But though he's hungry for success, he's French, he's arrogant and the food's pretentious.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241016053700 +0000" stop="20241016064000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's program is Clubway 41, despite being voted Blackpool Tourist Board Restaurant of the year, the place is dire straits. It is the prime example of HOW NOT TO RUN A RESTAURANT. Owner DAVE is the flakey self-appointed head chef, who hasn't been in a kitchen for 30 years and can't cook. His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce". Gordon faces a hellish week, Clubway 41 is breaking every rule in book, can he bring Dave, Dawn and their food back to earth?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241016064000 +0000" stop="20241016074000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Tonight's program sees Gordon Ramsay in Oscars in Nantwich. On the surface this place seems idyllic, an Irish family run restaurant in the heart of beautiful countryside. Owner MAURA runs the front of house and her son LENIN is the Head chef, but it's not "happy families". With her life savings on the line Maura is in big trouble. She constantly bickers with her son whilst the customers are forced to wait hours for their fluorescent crab stick paellas, and stodgy carbonaras from Oscars "bit of everything" menu.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241016074000 +0000" stop="20241016085000 +0000"><title>Addicted to Boob Jobs</title><desc>Journalist Louise Roe investigates why women in the United Kingdom have plastic surgery on their breasts not just once, but multiple times.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241016085000 +0000" stop="20241016095400 +0000"><title>The Perfect Vagina</title><desc>Lisa Rogers tries to find out why more and more women are considering vaginal surgery for either aesthetic or cultural reasons.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241016095400 +0000" stop="20241016105400 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers on Holiday</title><desc>At the parlour in the sun Sketch meets Peter who’s shocking tattoo is double trouble.
