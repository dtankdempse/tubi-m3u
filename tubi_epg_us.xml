Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241112005400 +0000" stop="20241112015700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241112015700 +0000" stop="20241112025900 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241112025900 +0000" stop="20241112040000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241112040000 +0000" stop="20241112050200 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241112050200 +0000" stop="20241112060400 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241112060400 +0000" stop="20241112070300 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>Family disputes lead to a sexual-abuse case.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241112070300 +0000" stop="20241112080000 +0000"><title>The Cops</title><desc>Family disputes lead to a sexual-abuse case.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241112080000 +0000" stop="20241112090300 +0000"><title>The Perfect Vagina</title><desc>Lisa Rogers tries to find out why more and more women are considering vaginal surgery for either aesthetic or cultural reasons.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241112090300 +0000" stop="20241112101300 +0000"><title>Addicted to Boob Jobs</title><desc>Journalist Louise Roe investigates why women in the United Kingdom have plastic surgery on their breasts not just once, but multiple times.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241112101300 +0000" stop="20241112101700 +0000"><title>Program information currently unavailable.</title></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241112101700 +0000" stop="20241112104600 +0000"><title>Chopper Squad</title><desc>An elite helicopter team of pilots and paramedics save lives in Auckland, New Zealand.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241112104600 +0000" stop="20241112111600 +0000"><title>Chopper Squad</title><desc>An elite helicopter team of pilots and paramedics save lives in Auckland, New Zealand.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241112111600 +0000" stop="20241112114500 +0000"><title>Chopper Squad</title><desc>An elite helicopter team of pilots and paramedics save lives in Auckland, New Zealand.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241112114500 +0000" stop="20241112121500 +0000"><title>Program information currently unavailable.</title></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241112121500 +0000" stop="20241112130700 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay visits Meson de Mesilla, a “luxury” Tuscan-style hotel in Las Cruces, New Mexico.
