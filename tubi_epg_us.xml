Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large. The detectives soon have to delve into a world of rock music, drug use and greed, to find the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241019013700 +0000" stop="20241019032400 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The suspicious death of popular young GP Dr Alan Delaney brings Barnaby and Jones to Midsomer Market to investigate. The detectives are baffled as to a motive for murder - until they consider that the newly engaged Dr James Kirkwood may have been the intended victim. Before long, Barnaby and Jones are heading to Wales - former home to Delyth Mostyn, James's fiancee, to delve deeper into the mystery. There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241019032400 +0000" stop="20241019051100 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village. The dispute seems harmless enough - until Lionel Bell is found murdered in a nearby woodland, strangled with the cord of his light meter. Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation. Barnaby is forced to work off the case to uncover who is framing him, and who wants dead other photographers in the village.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241019051100 +0000" stop="20241019065800 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The residents of Midsomer Magna are thrilled when a production crew arrives at the local manor house to film a version of The Scarlet Pimpernel.

But when the director, Nick Cheney, is found dead - his head severed by a prop guillotine - Barnaby must discover who would have wanted the victim dead. It soon becomes clear that things are not so simple, and the detectives soon have to shift through varying motives, layered by lies, hidden truths, and a possible robbery to be committed.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241019065800 +0000" stop="20241019084500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby is in Midsomer Holm, bidding farewell to reformed criminal Ronnie Tyler, who has taken part in a rehabilitation scheme in the village.

When Jack is murdered, the detective must delve into the dark secrets in the victim's past. There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death. It isn't long before he finds that Eddie Marston is attempting blackmail, and soon murdered as a result, and that Lord Holm is in love with Jack's wife, psychotherapist Gina.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241019084500 +0000" stop="20241019103400 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When wealthy landowner Gregory Lancaster's body goes missing on the night of his death, a sinister web of secrets and lies is exposed in the village of Little Malton.

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241019004600 +0000" stop="20241019014800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241019014800 +0000" stop="20241019025000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue is The Runaway Girl, a tapas bar-cum-nightclub in Sheffield city centre on the brink of collapse. The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241019025000 +0000" stop="20241019035300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point. The restaurant is on its last legs - they've run out of customers, money and hope. Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241019035300 +0000" stop="20241019044600 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay visits a “Caribbean” style resort hotel in Fort Pierce, Florida where the young inexperienced owner, Brian is making guests’ time at the hotel miserable with filthy rooms, late night concerts and shocking service.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241019044600 +0000" stop="20241019054000 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Island Park, Idaho to try and rescue the failing Angler’s Lodge.

The former chapel of a nineteenth-century convent, the restaurant is in a spectacularly beautiful location and offers bargain roast dinners from a carvery that's been running for twenty years. Scott bought the place for £300k but with an ageing clientele eating for half-price, he's losing £5,000 a week.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241019160400 +0000" stop="20241019170700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's second programme is Piccolo Teatro, a bijou vegetarian restaurant in Paris run by feisty Scot Rachel. A former waitress at the restaurant, Rachel bought it three years ago and now, along with best friend Stephanie, she's trying to convert the carnivorous French into a nation of veggies. For Gordon it's a sentimental journey to the city where he spent his formative years as a chef, a food mecca full of gastronomic delights that should be a dream.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241019170700 +0000" stop="20241019180900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's penultimate programme is The Curry Lounge in Nottingham, the city with more restaurants per square mile than any other in Britain. This 120-seater Indian restaurant has been run since January by ex sales director Raz who's new to the business - and it shows. Despite a ~500k refurbishment and décor like a Bollywood set the honeymoon period's well and truly over. His once-healthy trade is evaporating and at his current rate of loss it's uncertain he'll make it past Christmas.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241019180900 +0000" stop="20241019191000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers on Holiday</title><desc>The pop up parlour in the sun gets a visit from a noughties heartthrob.

Big soul momma, owner Charita Jones, produces a menu of irresistibly unique classics from the Deep South. The food's hard to fault but the punters are nowhere to be seen, Head Chef Brian and a rag-tag collection of part-timers are taking the mickey - and despite working a seven-day week Charita's got an empty restaurant and a ~£65,000 debt.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241020043400 +0000" stop="20241020053700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's fourth programme is La Riviera, a fine dining restaurant in Inverness.

Loic is on a mission, to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of haggis, tatties and deep-fried Mars bars. But though he's hungry for success, he's French, he's arrogant and the food's pretentious.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241020053700 +0000" stop="20241020064000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's program is Clubway 41, despite being voted Blackpool Tourist Board Restaurant of the year, the place is dire straits. It is the prime example of HOW NOT TO RUN A RESTAURANT. Owner DAVE is the flakey self-appointed head chef, who hasn't been in a kitchen for 30 years and can't cook. His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce".

On the surface this place seems idyllic, an Irish family run restaurant in the heart of beautiful countryside. Owner MAURA runs the front of house and her son LENIN is the Head chef, but it's not "happy families". With her life savings on the line Maura is in big trouble. She constantly bickers with her son whilst the customers are forced to wait hours for their fluorescent crab stick paellas, and stodgy carbonaras from Oscars "bit of everything" menu.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241020074000 +0000" stop="20241020085000 +0000"><title>Addicted to Boob Jobs</title><desc>Journalist Louise Roe investigates why women in the United Kingdom have plastic surgery on their breasts not just once, but multiple times.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241020085000 +0000" stop="20241020095400 +0000"><title>The Perfect Vagina</title><desc>Lisa Rogers tries to find out why more and more women are considering vaginal surgery for either aesthetic or cultural reasons.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241020095400 +0000" stop="20241020105400 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers on Holiday</title><desc>At the parlour in the sun Sketch meets Peter who’s shocking tattoo is double trouble.

Solving the crime required the keen insight of a criminal profiler and the perseverance of a family, local authorities, and the FBI.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241020035700 +0000" stop="20241020050200 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>Racial tensions in Buffalo in 1980 were at an all-time high.
