This one-of-a-kind home now serves as a gathering place for creatives and surfers alike, nestled between the forest and Oregon coast.On Huckberry Homes, we’ll be tapping into the most inspiring members of the Huckberry community to offer an inside peek into how they’ve crafted the place they call home. We will showcase everything from cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that inspire creativity and high-performing lives.We would like to take a moment to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples who have stewarded the land on which this video was created. This area was the home to the Nestucca peoples and other coastal tribes until the mid-1800s when the population was decimated by diseases from settlers. Those who remained were coerced into a coastal reservation by the US government. Let us remember the histories and cultures that have shaped this land."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241011073005 +0000" stop="20241011074110 +0000"><title>Huckberry Homes</title><desc>"In this special edition episode of Huckberry Homes, we travel to New York to get a rare look inside The Explorers Club headquarters.

From Roald Amundsen’s 1911 voyage to the South Pole to Sir Edmund Hillary’s ascent to the summit of Mount Everest to astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s history-changing 1969 expedition to the moon, the halls of this institution have echoed with tales of daring discovery and unparalleled human achievement.

One of which has a very huge part of Trent's heart being it is his biggest buck to date! Mufasa was a 226" buck that was on his In-laws farm. That hunt and property obviously became very special to him. From that moment Trent dreamed of owning a property just like it to try and grow even more deer of this caliber on his own. After starting his career with Midwest Land group Trent was able to create enough income to purchase his first ever farm, which happened to be the exact farm he killed his biggest buck "Mufasa" on. Trent made the farm his own and was very excited to hunt it for the very first time as the land owner. In the very same stand he released his arrow in for Mufasa he kills on his first hunt of the year and connects with his top target buck! An insane full circle of events makes this story one that Trent will never forget.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241012120014 +0000" stop="20241012130009 +0000"><title>Duck Camp Dinners</title><desc>The second split is here, and the crew decides to try their luck at historic Old Hickory in Lacour, Louisiana.

The DIRT team followed that current up the coastline, surfing with new friends and tasting new flavors.

One of which has a very huge part of Trent's heart being it is his biggest buck to date! Mufasa was a 226" buck that was on his In-laws farm. That hunt and property obviously became very special to him. From that moment Trent dreamed of owning a property just like it to try and grow even more deer of this caliber on his own. After starting his career with Midwest Land group Trent was able to create enough income to purchase his first ever farm, which happened to be the exact farm he killed his biggest buck "Mufasa" on. Trent made the farm his own and was very excited to hunt it for the very first time as the land owner. In the very same stand he released his arrow in for Mufasa he kills on his first hunt of the year and connects with his top target buck! An insane full circle of events makes this story one that Trent will never forget.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241012120014 +0000" stop="20241012130009 +0000"><title>Duck Camp Dinners</title><desc>The second split is here, and the crew decides to try their luck at historic Old Hickory in Lacour, Louisiana.
