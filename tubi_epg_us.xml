Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106004400 +0000" stop="20241106014600 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106014600 +0000" stop="20241106024900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue is The Runaway Girl, a tapas bar-cum-nightclub in Sheffield city centre on the brink of collapse. The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106024900 +0000" stop="20241106035100 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point. The restaurant is on its last legs - they've run out of customers, money and hope. Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106035100 +0000" stop="20241106044400 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay visits a “Caribbean” style resort hotel in Fort Pierce, Florida where the young inexperienced owner, Brian is making guests’ time at the hotel miserable with filthy rooms, late night concerts and shocking service.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106044400 +0000" stop="20241106053800 +0000"><title>Program information currently unavailable.</title></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106053800 +0000" stop="20241106063700 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>Marie ended up being rushed into hospital when surgery to remove excess skin left her with life threatening sepsis.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106063700 +0000" stop="20241106073700 +0000"><title>Plastic Surgery Knifemares</title><desc>Sue's 'cut price' tummy tuck in Turkey almost killed her and Oli's quest to become a Korean pop star led him to spend £100,000 to look like his Asian idols.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106073700 +0000" stop="20241106083400 +0000"><title>Program information currently unavailable.</title></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106083400 +0000" stop="20241106094400 +0000"><title>Addicted to Boob Jobs</title><desc>Journalist Louise Roe investigates why women in the United Kingdom have plastic surgery on their breasts not just once, but multiple times.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106094400 +0000" stop="20241106104800 +0000"><title>The Perfect Vagina</title><desc>Lisa Rogers tries to find out why more and more women are considering vaginal surgery for either aesthetic or cultural reasons.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106104800 +0000" stop="20241106114800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106114800 +0000" stop="20241106124800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106124800 +0000" stop="20241106134600 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>On a country road the crew of Helimed 98 launch a difficult rescue mission to free the elderly driver whose arm is trapped beneath his vehicle.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106134600 +0000" stop="20241106144300 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>On a country road the crew of Helimed 98 launch a difficult rescue mission to free the elderly driver whose arm is trapped beneath his vehicle.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106144300 +0000" stop="20241106154000 +0000"><title>Helicopter ER</title><desc>On a country road the crew of Helimed 98 launch a difficult rescue mission to free the elderly driver whose arm is trapped beneath his vehicle.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106154000 +0000" stop="20241106164000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106164000 +0000" stop="20241106174200 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106174200 +0000" stop="20241106184400 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106184400 +0000" stop="20241106194800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's third programme is Momma Cherri's Soul Food Shack, an intimate forty-seater a stone's throw from Brighton's sea front. Big soul momma, owner Charita Jones, produces a menu of irresistibly unique classics from the Deep South. The food's hard to fault but the punters are nowhere to be seen, Head Chef Brian and a rag-tag collection of part-timers are taking the mickey - and despite working a seven-day week Charita's got an empty restaurant and a ~£65,000 debt.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106194800 +0000" stop="20241106205000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's fourth programme is La Riviera, a fine dining restaurant in Inverness. Owned by multi-millionaire Barry Larson and costing ~£8000 a week to run, the place boasts top French chef Loic Lefebvre and an impeccably-trained kitchen staff with Michelin star-studded backgrounds. Loic is on a mission, to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of haggis, tatties and deep-fried Mars bars. But though he's hungry for success, he's French, he's arrogant and the food's pretentious.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106205000 +0000" stop="20241106215300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's program is Clubway 41, despite being voted Blackpool Tourist Board Restaurant of the year, the place is dire straits. It is the prime example of HOW NOT TO RUN A RESTAURANT. Owner DAVE is the flakey self-appointed head chef, who hasn't been in a kitchen for 30 years and can't cook. His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce". Gordon faces a hellish week, Clubway 41 is breaking every rule in book, can he bring Dave, Dawn and their food back to earth?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241106215300 +0000"
