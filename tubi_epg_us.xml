And what better way to break in a new boat than heading to some reefs and filling the cooler with one of the Gulf of Mexico’s most popular fish?</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241227130000 +0000" stop="20241227133001 +0000"><title>Chasin' The Sun</title><desc>There’s nothing like a change in weather conditions to wreck a perfectly good fishing plan, and that’s exactly what Capt. Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241227133001 +0000" stop="20241227140000 +0000"><title>Chasin' The Sun</title><desc>We return to the Ellie B and head a hundred miles offshore to repeat last year’s epic tuna bite.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

Each had been sitting in their patrol cars when a man sneaked up and opened fire. The FBI was brought in to help catch the cop killer.  Agents identified the man who was most likely the killer, but he was nowhere to be found.  Months of surveillance operations around the country finally yielded a break; they found their suspect in Baltimore, MD.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20241227110000 +0000" stop="20241227120000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>When violent criminals strike, the FBI strikes back, employing every available resource, and creating new ones when necessary.

Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure.

The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227050700 +0000" stop="20241227060900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point. The restaurant is on its last legs - they've run out of customers, money and hope. Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227060900 +0000" stop="20241227071300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Saturday night at The Glass House Restaurant in Ambleside was a disaster.

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers.

On the moors, paramedics Pete and Lee rescue an off road biker injured when his motorcycle toppled off a rock.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227155300 +0000" stop="20241227165500 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay starts his culinary journey in the north of India where he cooks for 400 passengers in an express train's cramped pantry car.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227165500 +0000" stop="20241227175900 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>Gordon immerses himself in the life of a local tribe in Nagaland, visits Assam to enter a housewives' competition and sets up shop on the streets of Calcutta.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227175900 +0000" stop="20241227190200 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>Gordon ends his travels to India by heading south, living in an ashram in Kerala and working alongside one of India's top chefs in Mumbai.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227190200 +0000" stop="20241227200400 +0000"><title>Hoarders, Get Your House in Order</title><desc>Amie Ormand's compulsive consuming is taking over her home and threatening her relationship.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227200400 +0000" stop="20241227210500 +0000"><title>Hoarders, Get Your House in Order</title><desc>Sylvia Stewart is struggling under the remnants of decades of out-of-control shopping; the 59-year-old widow is a self-confessed bargain hunter who estimates that she has spent around £100,000 amassing everything.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227210500 +0000" stop="20241227220600 +0000"><title>Hoarders, Get Your House in Order</title><desc>Stuart owns thousands of pounds worth of gadgets and clothes that he barely uses.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241227220600 +0000" stop="20241227225700 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay checks in to The River Rock Inn in Milford Pennsylvania, where owner Ken Pisciotta is over his head and drowning in debt.

They've both had successful careers in the brewery business so when they bought Moore Place they believed they could make it an instant success.  What they hadn't realized was just how difficult it would be to fill the 90-seater oak-paneled restaurant and how hard it would be to find a chef who could cook decent food.

Has Ramsay's fast-track guide to restaurant success helped these brewery whiz-kids transform their failing ex-Berni Inn into a profitable business? And is the building still painted that disgusting shade of purple?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241228061900 +0000" stop="20241228072400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The episode that has gone down in TV history. Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in "fine dining", he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241228072400 +0000" stop="20241228082000 +0000"><title>Tattoo

As the robbers became increasingly violent, pressure mounted to end their reign.  With few leads, the FBI forced their own luck.  The effort put them face to face with an armed and desperate fugitive.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241228093300 +0000" stop="20241228103800 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A day that began with a class field trip ended with a parent's worst nightmare.
