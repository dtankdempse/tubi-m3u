The company is thinking about increasing Tom's exposure by producing a new television show around him. Liz Madison is the advice columnist for the little read community newspaper, the Marin County Voice, which is a throwback to gentler times. Besides their journalistic occupations, one other similar aspect between Tom and Liz is that they are both currently single, with their friends and family doing whatever they can to find that special someone for their personal life. On November 2, the staff at the Voice learn that the Sun ownership has bought their newspaper, with the probable goal of folding it into the operations of the Sun. If this move does happen, the staff at the Voice will lose their jobs. To fight back, Liz decides to change her column to an editorial espousing the meaning of Christmas and the newspaper to the community.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241204070538 +0000" stop="20241204085504 +0000"><title>Hearts Under the Olive Tree</title><desc>Looking for inspiration for her next fantasy book, a renowned author is taken to a farmland retreat, where something even more magical awaits.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241204085504 +0000" stop="20241204104006 +0000"><title>Let Love Grow</title><desc>Landscape architect Evie meets her match with new client Ryan, whose daughters are her biggest fan.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241204104006 +0000" stop="20241204110911 +0000"><title>At Home With Tori</title><desc>Tori teams up with Million Dollar Matchmaker Patti Stanger to host a series of dates for Morgan, one of her single friends.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241204110911 +0000" stop="20241204114006 +0000"><title>At Home With Tori</title><desc>Tori is cooking for girls night and must figure out how to please both of her friends!</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241204114006 +0000" stop="20241204132540 +0000"><title>Candid About Love</title><desc>Laura must get reclusive artist Shane to premiere his work at a gallery to help her own career.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241204132540 +0000" stop="20241204151054 +0000"><title>Love on Retreat</title><desc>Sparks fly between Jenny and Nate at a corporate retreat, despite him being her boss’s brother.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241204151054 +0000" stop="20241204165530 +0000"><title>12 Dares of Christmas</title><desc>A high school teacher's quiet holidays get a jolt of spice as she and an assertive French teacher scramble to prepare a Christmas exchange program.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241204165530 +0000" stop="20241204184008 +0000"><title>Dance Together</title><desc>An injured dancer and a shy Deaf girl overcome bullies, disability stigma, and other high school obstacles.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241204184008 +0000" stop="20241204202500 +0000"><title>A Royal Makeover</title><desc>A royalty expert is tasked with turning an unkempt man into the king he is destined to be—and gets a little more out of the deal than she imagined.</desc></programme><programme channel="675569" start="20241204202500 +0000" stop="20241204221027 +0000"><title>A Father's Choice</title><desc>Two young sisters move to their carefree father’s ranch after their mother dies.

Simpson, her next door neighbour insists that she had been murdered, after she had seen her return from a walk in the woods, unnerved and shocked by something she had witnessed. When the post mortem confirms her death was no accident, the pair discover that nothing is what it seems to be within the little village as they try to find out what exactly she saw. Their investigation introduces Barnaby and Troy to many eccentric and quirky residents and soon turns up a web of sex, blackmail and lies, and the possibility that the murder could be connected to a shooting accident two years ago, which claimed another woman's life.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241204024400 +0000" stop="20241204044600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>After debating on who their next guest speaker should be, the Midsomer Worthy Writers' Circle decide to invite famous writer, Max Jennings, to their next meeting, despite opposition to the choice by Gerald Hadleigh, the group's chairman.

When Agnes's cousin, Esslyn Carmichael, inadvertently cuts his own throat during the final act, it's quickly discovered that the tape on the prop blade he had used was removed without anyone knowing. The detective is left wondering who had wanted to turn Esslyn's final act into a true coup de theatre, as he and Troy try to determine what the motive was behind the two murders.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241204064500 +0000" stop="20241204084600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Local villagers in Morton Fendle are up in arms, demanding answers from Alan Hollingsworth, the owner of a local craft centre they had invested in, after news comes out that it has recently fallen into financial turmoil. As tensions begin rising in the village, Barnaby soon suspects that something has happened to Alan's wife, Simone, when his behaviour suddenly changes. His suspicions are soon confirmed when it transpires that Simone was kidnapped, after one of Alan's neighbours is murdered, shortly after witnessing something they shouldn't have.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241204084600 +0000" stop="20241204103300 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>A disused airfield near Morton Fendle is the location for a romantic evening between young Simon Bright and his girlfriend Laura Sharp - absolutely nothing could ruin their date. The next morning, when Frances Kirby is out for her morning jog, she notices the vintage car they were in up at the airfield, containing Simon Bright's dead body, with Laura nowhere to be seen. Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes. Eventually, the Barnaby family plus Jones make it to a 40s style dance night at the village hall before more villagers start turning up dead.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241204103300 +0000" stop="20241204122000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>When Faith Alexander arrives in Midsomer County to meet her long-lost uncle Rex Masters, she gets a shock - Rex's staff had been told that she was dead. Things become even more complex when Rex's body is found in a nearby river, bearing wounds that suggest he was murdered. Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead. Several people soon come forward with multiple wills, which confuse the matter, but when two more people, close friends of Rex, are also murdered, the investigation raises question on the motive, leading Barnaby to wonder if it was down to finances, passion, or something from Rex's past.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241204122000 +0000" stop="20241204140700 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Following the death of Alan King while on a business trip to China, the family company, King's Crystal, is in financial trouble.

In addition to strife between members of the family, the factory workers are outraged at the loss of their jobs. So when company accountant Peter Baxter is found murdered, Barnaby and Jones suspect a disgruntled employee is to blame. But in order to investigate the matter further, Jones is forced to work undercover, and infiltrate the local group of Freemasons in the village.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241204140700 +0000" stop="20241204155400 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The music lovers of Midsomer County are delighted when a host of bands arrives for the Midsomer Rocks festival. Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large. The detectives soon have to delve into a world of rock music, drug use and greed, to find the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241204155400 +0000" stop="20241204174100 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The suspicious death of popular young GP Dr Alan Delaney brings Barnaby and Jones to Midsomer Market to investigate.

Before long, Barnaby and Jones are heading to Wales - former home to Delyth Mostyn, James's fiancee, to delve deeper into the mystery. There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241204174100 +0000" stop="20241204192800 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village. The dispute seems harmless enough - until Lionel Bell is found murdered in a nearby woodland, strangled with the cord of his light meter. Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation. Barnaby is forced to work off the case to uncover who is framing him, and who wants dead other photographers in the village.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241204192800 +0000" stop="20241204211500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>The residents of Midsomer Magna are thrilled when a production crew arrives at the local manor house to film a version of The Scarlet Pimpernel. But the crew members aren't the only visitors to the area - Jones has spotted notorious criminal George Ince nearby. But when the director, Nick Cheney, is found dead - his head severed by a prop guillotine - Barnaby must discover who would have wanted the victim dead. It soon becomes clear that things are not so simple, and the detectives soon have to shift through varying motives, layered by lies, hidden truths, and a possible robbery to be committed.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241204211500 +0000" stop="20241204230200 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby is in Midsomer Holm, bidding farewell to reformed criminal Ronnie Tyler, who has taken part in a rehabilitation scheme in the village. Also present is disgraced ex-policeman Jack Colby, a former colleague of Barnaby's – but Jack refuses to talk to his old friend. When Jack is murdered, the detective must delve into the dark secrets in the victim's past. There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death. It isn't long before he finds that Eddie Marston is attempting blackmail, and soon murdered as a result, and that Lord Holm is in love with Jack's wife, psychotherapist Gina.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241204230200 +0000" stop="20241205004900 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Prolific real estate agent Alexander Beauvoisin is murdered in front of a crowd at the unveiling of a new dolls house collection at Midsomer Museum of the family.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241205004900 +0000" stop="20241205023600 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>As the Barnabys prepare for Cully's wedding, Lord Fitzroy and Beth Porteous are married in the pretty village of Bledlow.

With their honeymoon cancelled, the Fitzroys must contend with a police presence in their home, as Barnaby and Jones try to learn more about the family history.

Tommy's son Lionel and grandson Dave, mayor of Causton and whom Barnaby does not like (owing to dodgy building work by the mayor's company), are thrilled, but the snooty Hammonds are decidedly less pleased. Henry, the patriarch of the Hammond family, is particularly riled by his insalubrious neighbours, and has nurtured a long-running feud with the Hickses. But the evening after a battle re-enactment in the village, Henry is murdered - and Barnaby must delve into the history of the two families to find the killer, discovering a web of fraud, lies, and hidden truths.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241205042400 +0000" stop="20241205061100 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Barnaby and Jones are in Dunstan to investigate the deaths of a reclusive couple.

His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce".

A loner and distrustful of authority, he lived off the land, poaching wildlife and selling the hides.  But when two game wardens confronted Dallas about his deeds, they were shot and killed.  After a massive manhunt, Dallas was captured and convicted, only to escape months later.  Making the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list, Dallas eluded the law for almost a year until the FBI tracked him down in a small town in California.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000091" start="20241205205600 +0000" stop="20241205215900 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In 1986, a small crime free Indiana town was turned inside out by the arrival of one dangerous stranger. After an officer was gunned down at point-blank range, the psychotic killer led investigators across the Midwest.

Six people died and more than a thousand were injured in the bomb blast that tore a 5-story crater in the building.
