Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241117140000 +0000" stop="20241117150000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Nick and Richard are self-confessed restaurant virgins.  They've both had successful careers in the brewery business so when they bought Moore Place they believed they could make it an instant success.  What they hadn't realized was just how difficult it would be to fill the 90-seater oak-paneled restaurant and how hard it would be to find a chef who could cook decent food.

Has Ramsay's fast-track guide to restaurant success helped these brewery whiz-kids transform their failing ex-Berni Inn into a profitable business?

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241117220000 +0000" stop="20241117230000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Nick and Richard are self-confessed restaurant virgins.

Style doesn’t end with your closet, it sparks to life there.On Huckberry Homes, we’ll be tapping into the most inspiring members of the Huckberry community to offer an inside peek into how they’ve crafted the place they call home. We will showcase everything from cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that inspire creativity and high-performing lives.For our first entry, we turned to Austin, Texas’ own Scott Ballew. Our good buddy, Scott, is a filmmaker and songwriter who owns a Bohemian bungalow in the heart of Austin’s first suburb. It’s a home now that serves as a creative incubator, gathering place, hideaway, recording studio -- and maybe, as a personal shrine of a man curated by the man himself."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241116030947 +0000" stop="20241116031952 +0000"><title>Huckberry Homes</title><desc>"In this special edition episode of Huckberry Homes, we travel to New York to get a rare look inside The Explorers Club headquarters. For the last 120 years, The Explorers Club has been the exclusive epicenter where legendary explorers come together to share some of the most incredible adventure stories ever told. From Roald Amundsen’s 1911 voyage to the South Pole to Sir Edmund Hillary’s ascent to the summit of Mount Everest to astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s history-changing 1969 expedition to the moon, the halls of this institution have echoed with tales of daring discovery and unparalleled human achievement. That’s why we’re beyond stoked to kick off our Huckberry x The Explorers Club partnership—featuring the Land, Sea, and Space Collection from an exclusive Whiskey Peaks collab and a badass grand prize. Tune in now to watch a tour so exclusive, it’s almost like being inducted into the club itself (minus the secret handshake)."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241116031952 +0000" stop="20241116033010 +0000"><title>Huckberry Homes</title><desc>"On this episode of Huckberry Homes, we caught our good friend and photographer James Barkman out in the wild.

La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241117114900 +0000" stop="20241117125000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire. The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241117125000 +0000" stop="20241117135000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241117135000 +0000" stop="20241117145000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241117145000 +0000" stop="20241117155000 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>This team of salty and creative tattoo artists come to the rescue of people whose tattoo don’ts need to be fixed and turned into masterpieces ASAP!</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241117155000 +0000" stop="20241117164900 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241117164900 +0000" stop="20241117175100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers: Extreme</title><desc>Uzzi catapults Melissa's tragic tattoo into outer space; Alice replaces Emma's fishy stinker; Pash erases Matt's not-so-sharp pencil; Morgan's chub rub gets covered with a design that's a bit less sore.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241117175100 +0000" stop="20241117184500 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay visits a “Caribbean” style resort hotel in Fort Pierce, Florida where the young inexperienced owner, Brian is making guests’ time at the hotel miserable with filthy rooms, late night concerts and shocking service.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241117184500 +0000" stop="20241117193900 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Island Park, Idaho to try and rescue the failing Angler’s Lodge.
