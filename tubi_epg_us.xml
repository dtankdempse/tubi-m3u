old partner-in-crime Dave Rickard (Basil Ruysdael). En route, McQueen dispatches a gang of bandits who try to rob the stagecoach and, in the process, wins the attentions of a young woman (Dorothy Malone) with whom he'd like to settle down.

Temps are abnormally hot in Argentina for this time of year and the animals will be heading for cover by mid day to stay cool.

It's ironic that his most challenging and physically brutal hunt is also the one that holds the number one spot in Mark's hunting career.

Twenty-eight-year-old owner and head chef Alex offers modern Italian cuisine, a taste of Little Italy in England's first garden city, and the restaurant is run by his best mate maitre dé Gavin, helped by his ex-air hostess girlfriend Emily. But Alex has no customers, cookers that don't work and an expensive menu that's about as authentically Italian as a spag bol.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115040600 +0000" stop="20241115050900 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's second programme is D-Place in Chelmsford, Essex run by Mexican-born Israel and his English partner Tara. They've sunk ~£150,000 of their own money into their trendy café bar which offers a vast selection of fusion cuisine. In charge is Executive Chef Philippe, producing everything from all-day breakfasts to hoi sin noodles with an astounding lack of flair; the plastic food is dire and boomerangs back from the dining room as soon as it's cooked.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115050900 +0000" stop="20241115061300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's third programme is Momma Cherri's Soul Food Shack, an intimate forty-seater a stone's throw from Brighton's sea front.

Loic is on a mission, to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of haggis, tatties and deep-fried Mars bars. But though he's hungry for success, he's French, he's arrogant and the food's pretentious.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115071400 +0000" stop="20241115081700 +0000"><title>The Kinky Sex Survey</title><desc>Ordinary people from across the U.K. reveal their favorite fetishes, kinks and unusual sexual practices; experts explain where unusual sexual desires come from and why there's no such thing as normal.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115081700 +0000" stop="20241115092000 +0000"><title>The Perfect Vagina</title><desc>Lisa Rogers tries to find out why more and more women are considering vaginal surgery for either aesthetic or cultural reasons.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115092000 +0000" stop="20241115103100 +0000"><title>Addicted to Boob Jobs</title><desc>Journalist Louise Roe investigates why women in the United Kingdom have plastic surgery on their breasts not just once, but multiple times.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115103100 +0000" stop="20241115110100 +0000"><title>Chopper Squad</title><desc>The chopper team struggle to save two young men who are feared to be drowned at Hahei; a Coromandel motorcyclist struggles with punctured lungs.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115110100 +0000" stop="20241115112900 +0000"><title>Chopper Squad</title><desc>A teenage motorcyclist fights for his life after crashing on a remote farm near Warkworth; a man suffers 2nd degree burns to his face and hands after an accidental explosion; four men go missing.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115112900 +0000" stop="20241115115800 +0000"><title>Chopper Squad</title><desc>The team battles to save a man trapped in his overturned Land Rover on Rakino Island; a star rugby player may have broken his neck during a game.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115115800 +0000" stop="20241115122700 +0000"><title>Program information currently unavailable.</title></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115122700 +0000" stop="20241115132300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115132300 +0000" stop="20241115141800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115141800 +0000" stop="20241115151500 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115151500 +0000" stop="20241115161700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Saturday night at The Glass House Restaurant in Ambleside was a disaster.  Orders in the kitchen were mixed up, the food wasn't cooked properly and the customers were complaining.  Not only was the chef in tears, but the owners were on the brink of bankruptcy.   

A few months on, there have been some departures from the Glass House. Who is in charge of the kitchen now? And, more importantly, is Ramsay's Caesar salad still on the menu?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115161700 +0000" stop="20241115172000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Walnut Tree Inn was in big trouble - there was no head chef, the customers had dwindled, and the owner had been forced to sell the family home to keep the business afloat.
Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115172000 +0000" stop="20241115182600 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Nick and Richard are self-confessed restaurant virgins.  They've both had successful careers in the brewery business so when they bought Moore Place they believed they could make it an instant success.  What they hadn't realized was just how difficult it would be to fill the 90-seater oak-paneled restaurant and how hard it would be to find a chef who could cook decent food.

Has Ramsay's fast-track guide to restaurant success helped these brewery whiz-kids transform their failing ex-Berni Inn into a profitable business? And is the building still painted that disgusting shade of purple?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115182600 +0000" stop="20241115193000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The episode that has gone down in TV history. Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in "fine dining", he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115193000 +0000" stop="20241115203100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115203100 +0000" stop="20241115213300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115213300 +0000" stop="20241115223400 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115223400 +0000" stop="20241115232800 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay checks in to The River Rock Inn in Milford Pennsylvania, where owner Ken Pisciotta is over his head and drowning in debt.
