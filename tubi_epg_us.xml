With a brother- sister team hanging by a thread and a three-way hurdle, this week’s Sweeper writes itself into the History books. Tonight is also the night we meet Buffman, a pint sized Superhero with a twitch and a photo finish at the Dizzy Dummy threatens extinction to a Rare Breed. A week of action packed Wipeouts with Latin Dancing lotharios, what more can you ask for?

This 120-seater Indian restaurant has been run since January by ex sales director Raz who's new to the business - and it shows. Despite a ~500k refurbishment and décor like a Bollywood set the honeymoon period's well and truly over. His once-healthy trade is evaporating and at his current rate of loss it's uncertain he'll make it past Christmas.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241021223200 +0000" stop="20241021233400 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is Ruby Tates in Brighton, owned and run by ex-actor and failed Hollywood wannabe ALLAN LOVE.

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><channel id="715948"><display-name>Family Unscripted</display-name><icon
