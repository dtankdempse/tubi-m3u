Taking four animals, this is one of the best morning hunts he has had yet. After an already incredible week of hunting, Mark is looking for a few species that caught his attention earlier in the trip and turns up a Hybrid Sheep, Hybrid Mouflon, Feral Goat and a Multi Horn Sheep. Temps are abnormally hot in Argentina for this time of year and the animals will be heading for cover by mid day to stay cool. Mark and his guide Charley make a plan to cover a lot of ground in hopes of catching them out feeding before they disappear.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241023072035 +0000" stop="20241023073022 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Mark Peterson heads south to Florida after an alligator. On this adventure, Mark is toting his Gunwerks BlastR handgun as he hunts the swamps with his sights set on a big mature gator. Alligators are typically judged in the field by looking at the distance from their eyes to the tip of their nose. The rule of thumb is that they grow a foot in length every year until they are eight years old, then grown an inch per year after that. At 13 feet 3 inches, this old gator is one for the books.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241023073022 +0000" stop="20241023075337 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Hunting off the northeastern coast of Australia on Marble island could be one of the most beautiful sceneries in the world.

That answer would quickly be followed up with "Blue Sheep Hunting in Pakistan, hands down". Here, Mark takes you back to 2017 to the first (and still only) filmed hunt for Blue Sheep in Northern Pakistan. It's ironic that his most challenging and physically brutal hunt is also the one that holds the number one spot in Mark's hunting career.

Aoudad were introduced to Texas as an exotic species and it didn't take long for them to establish a large viable population in the ideal habitat that West Texas offers. Going into this hunt with the confidence and extended range that only Gunwerks can provide, Mark knows the odds are in his favor and it doesn't take long to come across multiple bands of rams.

Temps are abnormally hot in Argentina for this time of year and the animals will be heading for cover by mid day to stay cool.

On this adventure, Mark is toting his Gunwerks BlastR handgun as he hunts the swamps with his sights set on a big mature gator. Alligators are typically judged in the field by looking at the distance from their eyes to the tip of their nose. The rule of thumb is that they grow a foot in length every year until they are eight years old, then grown an inch per year after that. At 13 feet 3 inches, this old gator is one for the books.</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241023073022 +0000" stop="20241023075337 +0000"><title>The Journey Within</title><desc>Hunting off the northeastern coast of Australia on Marble island could be one of the most beautiful sceneries in the world.

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241023004600 +0000" stop="20241023014800 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241023014800 +0000" stop="20241023025000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue is The Runaway Girl, a tapas bar-cum-nightclub in Sheffield city centre on the brink of collapse. The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241023025000 +0000" stop="20241023035300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point. The restaurant is on its last legs - they've run out of customers, money and hope. Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241023035300 +0000" stop="20241023044600 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay visits a “Caribbean” style resort hotel in Fort Pierce, Florida where the young inexperienced owner, Brian is making guests’ time at the hotel miserable with filthy rooms, late night concerts and shocking service.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241023044600 +0000" stop="20241023054000 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon visits Island Park, Idaho to try and rescue the failing Angler’s Lodge.
