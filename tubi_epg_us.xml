Second only to Alaska in size, Texas is known as the place where everything is bigger. From big college football games to endless oil fields and vast wind farms, Texas is home to more than 30 million Americans. But the state is about more than just big oil, college football and cattle farms - it's also home to some of the best boating in the country. Boasting a myriad of waterways, boaters here enjoy hundreds of lakes, rivers and streams that provide recreational opportunities, abundant wildlife and plenty of fishing. From Austin Texas to San Antonio host Ryan McVinney and the Boat Trader crew explore the laid-back Texas lake life including boat up restaurants along the Colorado River, watersports in Austin and the history of the waterways throughout the region. Boat manufacturers highlighted in this episode are Tige Boats and ATX Surf Boats, two premium Texas-based wake boat brands known for their high-quality, cutting-edge vessels that come equipped with advanced wake shaping technologies and equipment ideal for water skiing, wake surfing and wakeboarding. There's even a wake surfing dog!</desc></programme><channel id="400000065"><display-name>Top Gear</display-name><icon src="https://canvas.tubitv.com/opts/K8HQEXhF_Iy_eQ==/30a1f8b9-c414-4d47-a7ec-4f4f6792aed2/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjJAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="400000065" start="20241126005319 +0000" stop="20241126020558 +0000"><title>Top Gear UK</title><desc>Chris, Freddie and Paddy build their own battery-powered sports car on a budget.

Caroline Cave are house-hunting in Midsomer Newton. Shortly before leaving their hotel they mention they haven't been able to find what they're looking for; "something old and derelict that they can do up." Anne Merrick tells them about Winyard, a tumbledown cottage in the woods, might be for sale. At the estate agents they are told the house is not yet available for viewing. Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter. The next morning they are found strangled in their own car.

For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241127184600 +0000" stop="20241127194700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is Ruby Tates in Brighton, owned and run by ex-actor and failed Hollywood wannabe ALLAN LOVE.
