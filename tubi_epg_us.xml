This week we are forced to take notice of Demolition Dave, a 49 yr old South Australia man who thanks to some home training smashes the qualifier. For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241014100621 +0000" stop="20241014110139 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>This week contestants on Wipeout Australia are bought undone by a seemingly simple obstacle on the Qualifier, the Slippery Stairs. It’s all in the name really, an innocent set of stairs, covered in Wipeout Crash cream. Its up the way and down the way for all and sundry. The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris. It’s a colourful week with leotards, laughs and lots of ladies.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241014110139 +0000" stop="20241014115745 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>Fashion comes to Wipeout Australia as we meet Adam “God’s Gift” Marshall, a self styled Ad man who conquers the Qualifier. Other Catwalk moments include the Grandpa in his Red Speedos and a Rainbow Bright Personal Ad. If jumping a revolving arm while balancing on a pedestal above water isn’t enough for you then you’ll love this weeks Sweeper. Contestants are armed with Dodgeballs, to be deployed at each other, creating horrific hits and spectacular spills. The Dizzy Dummy claims its first victim as Dummy Tummy rejects a contestant and the Wipeout Zone becomes a battle of young and old.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241014115745 +0000" stop="20241014131058 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>This is the 'Legends Special' with all of the worst but funniest competitors from the last three series.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241014131058 +0000" stop="20241014142609 +0000"><title>Program information currently unavailable.</title></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241014142609 +0000" stop="20241014153934 +0000"><title>Total Wipeout</title><desc>In this episode, twenty intrepid contestants take on four gruelling obstacles.</desc></programme><programme channel="670603" start="20241014153934 +0000" stop="20241014163401 +0000"><title>Wipeout Australia</title><desc>Showdowns don’t come more epic than this.

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241013170000 +0000" stop="20241013180000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Nick and Richard are self-confessed restaurant virgins.  They've both had successful careers in the brewery business so when they bought Moore Place they believed they could make it an instant success.  What they hadn't realized was just how difficult it would be to fill the 90-seater oak-paneled restaurant and how hard it would be to find a chef who could cook decent food.

Has Ramsay's fast-track guide to restaurant success helped these brewery whiz-kids transform their failing ex-Berni Inn into a profitable business? And is the building still painted that disgusting shade of purple?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241013180000 +0000" stop="20241013190000 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>S01:E01 - Episode 1</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241013190000 +0000" stop="20241013200000 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>S01:E02 - Episode 2</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241013200000 +0000" stop="20241013210000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The episode that has gone down in TV history.

Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant.

Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in "fine dining", he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart.
