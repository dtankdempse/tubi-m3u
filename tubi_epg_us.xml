Argentina's borders were closed during the peak of COVID, so these animals have not been hunted for two years, which led to a game rich environment and excellent trophy quality.

Taking four animals, this is one of the best morning hunts he has had yet. After an already incredible week of hunting, Mark is looking for a few species that caught his attention earlier in the trip and turns up a Hybrid Sheep, Hybrid Mouflon, Feral Goat and a Multi Horn Sheep. Temps are abnormally hot in Argentina for this time of year and the animals will be heading for cover by mid day to stay cool.

Mark has a few close calls with a giant stag. One encounter lands him 15 yards from his target stag, but Mark couldn’t stop him from going into the nearby thicket.

That answer would quickly be followed up with "Blue Sheep Hunting in Pakistan, hands down". Here, Mark takes you back to 2017 to the first (and still only) filmed hunt for Blue Sheep in Northern Pakistan. It's ironic that his most challenging and physically brutal hunt is also the one that holds the number one spot in Mark's hunting career.

Style doesn’t end with your closet, it sparks to life there.On Huckberry Homes, we’ll be tapping into the most inspiring members of the Huckberry community to offer an inside peek into how they’ve crafted the place they call home. We will showcase everything from cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that inspire creativity and high-performing lives.For our first entry, we turned to Austin, Texas’ own Scott Ballew. Our good buddy, Scott, is a filmmaker and songwriter who owns a Bohemian bungalow in the heart of Austin’s first suburb. It’s a home now that serves as a creative incubator, gathering place, hideaway, recording studio -- and maybe, as a personal shrine of a man curated by the man himself."</desc></programme><programme channel="400000000" start="20241116030947 +0000" stop="20241116031952 +0000"><title>Huckberry Homes</title><desc>"In this special edition episode of Huckberry Homes, we travel to New York to get a rare look inside The Explorers Club headquarters.

The next morning they are found strangled in their own car. DCI Barnaby starts the investigation with the help of PC Ben Jones and they come across the world of estate agents, identical twins, ghosts, piano wire, and more before another body turns up.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241116171900 +0000" stop="20241116191300 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Villagers of Midsomer Barton are all set to celebrate Oak Apple Week, especially as the carnival queen event is set to return after an eight year absence. Yet the body of the mother of a deceased, one-time carnival queen, found in a stream, looks set to spoil things, as Barnaby and Jones find themselves digging up the past. From familiar faces, to drunken boasts and hidden obessions, it slowly becomes clear that the mother's daughter might be the key to solving the murder, when more deaths follow.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241116191300 +0000" stop="20241116210000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Wealthy, eccentric and obese aristocrat Freddy Butler drops dead, shortly after gathering all three of his wives at Haddington Hall to make an announcement. Although George Bullard is adamant his death is from natural causes, the case is far from simple when Freddy's solicitor is deliberately killed in a house fire shortly afterwards and Freddy's will goes missing. Barnaby and Jones find themselves investigating the extended Butler family, uncovering hidden secrets, illegitimate children and elusive treasure in the process.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241116210000 +0000" stop="20241116224800 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>Martin Barrett, a local council clerk living in Midsomer Worthy, is murdered during the night by shotgun, prompting Barnaby and Jones to find a motive for his murder. When they discover that Barrett was an expert blackmailer, his victims become prime suspects for his death - from a local pub landlord, a cleaner, a prominent member of the police board, to a former marine geologist. As they investigate, finding themselves drawn to the seaside, they slowly uncover deception, theft, attempted blackmail and hatred.</desc></programme><programme channel="700415" start="20241116224800 +0000" stop="20241117003500 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>In the village of Broughton, a ninety-year-old battle of the sexes has often occurred, with men trying to oppose an event that the women have managed to successfully hold without interruption, until it culminates with casualties on both sides - Mildred Danvers, an elderly woman who had returned on the day of a funeral and poisoned in her hotel room, and Rev. Anthony Gant, shot during a major event being held in the village green, in view of many. It soon becomes clear someone may have wished to kill both to cover up a dark truth, and soon Barnaby has to figure out who amongst the village wanted both dead, complicated further when Gant's curate is murdered next.</desc></programme><channel id="671073"><display-name>Unsolved Mysteries</display-name><icon src="https://canvas.tubitv.com/opts/Qx5hBhnp1aNAZg==/864892f9-3ab0-4950-9f8b-189ec2d92c20/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjJAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="671073" start="20241115011600 +0000" stop="20241115021400 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Negro y Azul &amp; Actualización, Conductor Ebrio &amp; Actualización, Yeti y Las Cenizas de Jane Doe.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241115021400 +0000" stop="20241115030900 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Asesino de Agente de Bienes Raíces, Cruz Milagrosa, Actualización: Robbinghood y Fraude Nudista.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241115030900 +0000" stop="20241115041400 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Amigo Por Correspondencia del Centro Comercial &amp; Actualización; Actualización: Pulgares, Tren de Huérfanos &amp; Actualización y Dorothy Allison Partes 1 &amp; 2.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241115041400 +0000" stop="20241115051300 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: Hess Partes 1 &amp; 2, El Deambulador y Asesinato de Arlington &amp; Actualización.</desc></programme><programme channel="671073" start="20241115051300 +0000" stop="20241115061500 +0000"><title>Misterios Sin Revolver</title><desc>Este episodio incluye: El Oro de Victorio Partes 1 &amp; 2, ¿Dónde Está Kari?

In charge is Executive Chef Philippe, producing everything from all-day breakfasts to hoi sin noodles with an astounding lack of flair; the plastic food is dire and boomerangs back from the dining room as soon as it's cooked.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115050900 +0000" stop="20241115061300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's third programme is Momma Cherri's Soul Food Shack, an intimate forty-seater a stone's throw from Brighton's sea front.

Loic is on a mission, to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of haggis, tatties and deep-fried Mars bars. But though he's hungry for success, he's French, he's arrogant and the food's pretentious.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115071400 +0000" stop="20241115081700 +0000"><title>The Kinky Sex Survey</title><desc>Ordinary people from across the U.K. reveal their favorite fetishes, kinks and unusual sexual practices; experts explain where unusual sexual desires come from and why there's no such thing as normal.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115081700 +0000" stop="20241115092000 +0000"><title>The Perfect Vagina</title><desc>Lisa Rogers tries to find out why more and more women are considering vaginal surgery for either aesthetic or cultural reasons.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115092000 +0000" stop="20241115103100 +0000"><title>Addicted to Boob Jobs</title><desc>Journalist Louise Roe investigates why women in the United Kingdom have plastic surgery on their breasts not just once, but multiple times.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115103100 +0000" stop="20241115110100 +0000"><title>Chopper Squad</title><desc>The chopper team struggle to save two young men who are feared to be drowned at Hahei; a Coromandel motorcyclist struggles with punctured lungs.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115110100 +0000" stop="20241115112900 +0000"><title>Chopper Squad</title><desc>A teenage motorcyclist fights for his life after crashing on a remote farm near Warkworth; a man suffers 2nd degree burns to his face and hands after an accidental explosion; four men go missing.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115112900 +0000" stop="20241115115800 +0000"><title>Chopper Squad</title><desc>The team battles to save a man trapped in his overturned Land Rover on Rakino Island; a star rugby player may have broken his neck during a game.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115115800 +0000" stop="20241115122700 +0000"><title>Program information currently unavailable.</title></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115122700 +0000" stop="20241115132300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115132300 +0000" stop="20241115141800 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115141800 +0000" stop="20241115151500 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115151500 +0000" stop="20241115161700 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Saturday night at The Glass House Restaurant in Ambleside was a disaster.  Orders in the kitchen were mixed up, the food wasn't cooked properly and the customers were complaining.  Not only was the chef in tears, but the owners were on the brink of bankruptcy.   

A few months on, there have been some departures from the Glass House. Who is in charge of the kitchen now? And, more importantly, is Ramsay's Caesar salad still on the menu?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115161700 +0000" stop="20241115172000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Walnut Tree Inn was in big trouble - there was no head chef, the customers had dwindled, and the owner had been forced to sell the family home to keep the business afloat.
Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115172000 +0000" stop="20241115182600 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Nick and Richard are self-confessed restaurant virgins.  They've both had successful careers in the brewery business so when they bought Moore Place they believed they could make it an instant success.  What they hadn't realized was just how difficult it would be to fill the 90-seater oak-paneled restaurant and how hard it would be to find a chef who could cook decent food.

Has Ramsay's fast-track guide to restaurant success helped these brewery whiz-kids transform their failing ex-Berni Inn into a profitable business? And is the building still painted that disgusting shade of purple?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115182600 +0000" stop="20241115193000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The episode that has gone down in TV history. Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in "fine dining", he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115193000 +0000" stop="20241115203100 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115203100 +0000" stop="20241115213300 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115213300 +0000" stop="20241115223400 +0000"><title>Tattoo Fixers</title><desc>It’s Merry Fixmas for the Tattoo Fixers who are on hand to deal with a host of Christmas themed tattoo disasters.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241115223400 +0000" stop="20241115232800 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay checks in to The River Rock Inn in Milford Pennsylvania, where owner Ken Pisciotta is over his head and drowning in debt.
