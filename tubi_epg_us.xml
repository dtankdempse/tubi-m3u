Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241221210000 +0000"

You Do?</title><desc>Using hidden cameras, host John Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241221210000 +0000" stop="20241221213000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend: Saturday</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241221213000 +0000" stop="20241221220000 +0000"><title>Zombie Wells: The Threat Beneath</title><desc>ABC News Live Special Programming.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241221220000 +0000" stop="20241221223000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend: Saturday</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241221223000 +0000" stop="20241221230000 +0000"><title>The Playlist</title><desc>ABC News Live sits down one-on-one with some of music's most influential artists to hear the story behind the sound.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241221230000 +0000" stop="20241222010000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241222010000 +0000" stop="20241222030000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241222030000 +0000" stop="20241222040000 +0000"><title>Out100</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241222040000 +0000" stop="20241222050000 +0000"><title>Price of Fame: The Liam Payne Story -- A Special Edition of 20/20</title><desc>Exploring Liam Payne's meteoric rise to celebrity as a member of boy band One Direction and his personal journey, including his struggles with mental health and the pressures of stardom.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241222050000 +0000" stop="20241222060000 +0000"><title>Manhunt: Luigi Mangione and the CEO Murder -- A Special Edition of 20/20</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241222060000 +0000" stop="20241222080000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241222080000 +0000" stop="20241222090000 +0000"><title>Out100</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241222090000 +0000" stop="20241222110000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241222110000 +0000" stop="20241222130000 +0000"><title>20/20</title><desc>Award-winning program anchored by David Muir, featuring unforgettable, character-driven true crime mysteries, exclusive newsmaker interviews, hard-hitting investigative reports and in-depth coverage of high profile stories.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241222130000 +0000" stop="20241222133000 +0000"><title>ABC News Live Weekend</title><desc>Description Unavailable</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20241222133000 +0000" stop="20241222140000 +0000"><title>GMA Life</title><desc>A weekly roundup of the best lifestyle content from "Good Morning America";

Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in "fine dining", he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241222140000 +0000" stop="20241222150000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Saturday night at The Glass House Restaurant in Ambleside was a disaster.  Orders in the kitchen were mixed up, the food wasn't cooked properly and the customers were complaining.  Not only was the chef in tears, but the owners were on the brink of bankruptcy.   

A few months on, there have been some departures from the Glass House. Who is in charge of the kitchen now? And, more importantly, is Ramsay's Caesar salad still on the menu?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241222150000 +0000" stop="20241222160000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S04:E09 - Episode 9</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241222160000 +0000" stop="20241222170000 +0000"><title>The F Word</title><desc>S04:E10 - Episode 10</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241222170000 +0000" stop="20241222180000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The Walnut Tree Inn was in big trouble - there was no head chef, the customers had dwindled, and the owner had been forced to sell the family home to keep the business afloat.
Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers.

What they hadn't realized was just how difficult it would be to fill the 90-seater oak-paneled restaurant and how hard it would be to find a chef who could cook decent food.

Has Ramsay's fast-track guide to restaurant success helped these brewery whiz-kids transform their failing ex-Berni Inn into a profitable business?

Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in "fine dining", he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20241222220000 +0000" stop="20241222230000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>Saturday night at The Glass House Restaurant in Ambleside was a disaster.

A few months on, there have been some departures from the Glass House. Who is in charge of the kitchen now?

We will showcase everything from cold plunges to vinyl listening rooms, home gyms and offices, and other tools that inspire creativity and high-performing lives.We would like to take a moment to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples who have stewarded the land on which this video was created. This area was the home to the Nestucca peoples and other coastal tribes until the mid-1800s when the population was decimated by diseases from settlers. Those who remained were coerced into a coastal reservation by the US government.

From an extensive investigation by the Viennese police, it was determined that these murders were the work of one sadistic predator.  Europe was dealing with a serial killer.  With no experience with this kind of predator, Viennese police turned to the FBI. FBI profilers were able to identify a suspect in the murders.  More ominously, they linked this same killer to murders committed in the United States.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20241222150000 +0000" stop="20241222160000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>In the late 1970s, the FBI had a working knowledge of anti-Castro terrorists operating in the United States.

FBI field offices from New York to Miami coordinated their efforts, determined to catch the vicious killers.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20241222160000 +0000" stop="20241222170000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A man is found suffocated in his Pennsylvania home, his checkbook, credit cards and vehicle appear to have been stolen.  Fingerprints from the victim identify a recent escapee from a minimum-security prison, as well as his girlfriend.

Disguises and speed protected their identity from cameras and the police as they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, always leaving a bomb to terrorize their victims. The stakes were raised when the FBI discovered the robbers had an agenda beyond their personal wealth. To stop these extremists and their growing operation, the FBI needed to capture their leaders.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20241222180000 +0000" stop="20241222190000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A day that began with a class field trip ended with a parent's worst nightmare.  An 11-year-old girl was missing.  Her parents were certain she was no runaway.  When they failed to find her in their quiet Illinois neighborhood, they called the police.  The FBI soon joined the investigation and family and friends worked with detectives and agents in an urgent search for the missing girl.  Faced with conflicting witness reports and false leads, agents wouldn't stop until they found the girl, and the truth.</desc></programme><programme channel="682630" start="20241222190000 +0000" stop="20241222200000 +0000"><title>The FBI Files</title><desc>A New Jersey State Trooper is shot to death on the side of Interstate 80 near the Pennsylvania border.

The food's hard to fault but the punters are nowhere to be seen, Head Chef Brian and a rag-tag collection of part-timers are taking the mickey - and despite working a seven-day week Charita's got an empty restaurant and a ~£65,000 debt.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20241222210300 +0000" stop="20241222220500 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>The venue for tonight's fourth programme is La Riviera, a fine dining restaurant in Inverness.

His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from "tomato and cointreau soup" to "pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce".

Owner MAURA runs the front of house and her son LENIN is the Head chef, but it's not "happy families". With her life savings on the line Maura is in big trouble. She constantly bickers with her son whilst the customers are forced to wait hours for their fluorescent crab stick paellas, and stodgy carbonaras from Oscars "bit of everything"
