Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc></programme><programme channel="618762" start="20250105090000 +0000"

several gunfighters in a single day. But Robles, a Mexican, seethes over the town's racism, and is warned by kindly nurse Estella (Katy Jurado) that without his gun, he would not last very long. That theory is put to the test when the new sheriff injures his wrist fighting with Ed Bannister (Peter Whitney), who upon learning about it, challenges Robles to a duel.</desc></programme><programme channel="684170" start="20250104030000 +0000" stop="20250104050000 +0000"><title>The Ride Back</title><desc>Determined to redeem his life as a failure, Sheriff Chris Hamish (William Conrad) crosses the Mexican border to find outlaw named Kallen (Anthony Quinn) and extradite him to Texas for a fair trial.

The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250105110000 +0000" stop="20250105120000 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>S01:E03 - Episode 3</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250105120000 +0000" stop="20250105130000 +0000"><title>Gordon's Great Escape</title><desc>S02:E01 - Vietnam</desc></programme><programme channel="677011" start="20250105130000 +0000" stop="20250105140000 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast.

New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal.

La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250105195000 +0000" stop="20250105205300 +0000"><title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title><desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire.

Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250105205300 +0000" stop="20250105215500 +0000"><title>Gordon Ramsay: Shark Bait</title><desc>Gordon Ramsay sets out to investigate the controversial "shark fin soup."</desc></programme><programme channel="667442" start="20250105215500 +0000" stop="20250105224900 +0000"><title>Hotel Hell</title><desc>The Vienna owner’s Jonathan and Lisa Krach are at their breaking point and have become trapped in their Austrian themed hotel, drowning in debt.
