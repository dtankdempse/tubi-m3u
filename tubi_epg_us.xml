behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited.

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else!

Anthony Gant, shot during a major event being held in the village green, in view of many. It soon becomes clear someone may have wished to kill both to cover up a dark truth, and soon Barnaby has to figure out who amongst the village wanted both dead, complicated further when Gant's curate is murdered next.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241125090000 +0000" stop="20241125110000 +0000"><title>Midsomer Murders</title><desc>A disused airfield near Morton Fendle is the location for a romantic evening between young Simon Bright and his girlfriend Laura Sharp - absolutely nothing could ruin their date. The next morning, when Frances Kirby is out for her morning jog, she notices the vintage car they were in up at the airfield, containing Simon Bright's dead body, with Laura nowhere to be seen. Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes. Eventually, the Barnaby family plus Jones make it to a 40s style dance night at the village hall before more villagers start turning up dead.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241125110000 +0000" stop="20241125120000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>Shade and Angie investigate the case of a missing Army Cadet.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241125120000 +0000" stop="20241125130000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>When a boxer asks Shade to prove a match was fixed, Shade and Angie bring Nora in as a gambling advisor.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241125130000 +0000" stop="20241125140000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>Shade and Angie go undercover when the king from Medieval Times believes he's been poisoned.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241125140000 +0000" stop="20241125150000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>Shade and Angie are hired by the owner of a luxurious rustic lodge to investigate an infidelity case but their client ends up dead.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241125150000 +0000" stop="20241125160000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>During a routine sting operation, Shade and Angie pick up an unexpected fare with Maz and Nolan hot on their trail.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241125160000 +0000" stop="20241125170000 +0000"><title>Private Eyes</title><desc>Maz's sister comes to Angie for help recovering an aquatic creature that's gone missing from Ripley's Aquarium.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241125170000 +0000" stop="20241125180000 +0000"><title>Hudson &amp; Rex</title><desc>Charlie and Rex are on the case after a social media star dies while livestreaming her wedding.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241125180000 +0000" stop="20241125190000 +0000"><title>Hudson &amp; Rex</title><desc>As Charlie and Rex head into the woods to track a missing photographer, a mysterious organization throws the investigation off its trail.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241125190000 +0000" stop="20241125200000 +0000"><title>Hudson &amp; Rex</title><desc>Charlie and Rex investigate a fantasy role-playing game turned deadly when a player is found slain by a sword.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241125200000 +0000" stop="20241125210000 +0000"><title>Hudson &amp; Rex</title><desc>Charlie and Rex are in deep water after a university rower is shot by a sniper during team practice.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241125210000 +0000" stop="20241125220000 +0000"><title>Hudson &amp; Rex</title><desc>Cultures clash when the death of a Parisian journalist has Charlie and Rex partnering with a French detective in an investigation that whisks the team to Saint Pierre and Miquelon.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241125220000 +0000" stop="20241125230000 +0000"><title>Hudson &amp; Rex</title><desc>Charlie and Rex follow the route of a killer after a tech engineer is found dead in her company's self-driving car.</desc></programme><programme channel="684165" start="20241125230000 +0000" stop="20241126000000 +0000"><title>Hudson &amp; Rex</title><desc>When a prominent member of an exclusive dating app is found with an arrow through his heart, Charlie must go under cover in the online dating scene.</desc></programme><channel id="715943"><display-name>Watchlist</display-name><icon src="https://canvas.tubitv.com/opts/s6Qjg49BjoBogA==/3f255caf-ac21-456a-add4-31745babe3cb/CHgQeDoFMS4xLjJAAQ==" /></channel><programme channel="715943" start="20241124011803 +0000" stop="20241124022007 +0000"><title>Westworld</title><desc>Maeve discovers that "Warworld" is not what it seems.</desc></programme><programme channel="715943" start="20241124022007 +0000" stop="20241124032149 +0000"><title>Westworld</title><desc>Dolores and Caleb's relationship evolves.</desc></programme><programme channel="715943" start="20241124032149 +0000" stop="20241124042549 +0000"><title>Westworld</title><desc>The Man in Black learns the truth doesn't set you free.</desc></programme><programme channel="715943" start="20241124042549 +0000" stop="20241124051233 +0000"><title>The Tomorrow People</title><desc>Jedikiah forces Stephen to protect his brother, Luca.</desc></programme><programme channel="715943" start="20241124051233 +0000" stop="20241124055652 +0000"><title>The Tomorrow People</title><desc>Ultra and the Tomorrow People consider a potential truce.</desc></programme><programme channel="715943" start="20241124055652 +0000" stop="20241124064138 +0000"><title>The Tomorrow People</title><desc>Roger's possible return is on the horizon.</desc></programme><programme channel="715943" start="20241124064138 +0000" stop="20241124073011 +0000"><title>Babylon 5</title><desc>A telepath is assaulted.
